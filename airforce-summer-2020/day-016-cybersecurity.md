> 2 00:00:05.970 --&gt; 00:00:08.010 Michael Chase: Those two are both is fine playing
>
> 3 00:00:11.370 --&gt; 00:00:12.000 Michael Chase: Out in space.
>
> 4 00:00:14.639 --&gt; 00:00:16.289 Michael Chase: That is an international level.
>
> 5 00:00:17.940 --&gt; 00:00:20.070 Michael Chase: That he works. He works web
>
> 6 00:00:22.260 --&gt; 00:00:23.220 Michael Chase: Versions of a lag.
>
> 7 00:00:26.280 --&gt; 00:00:29.310 Michael Chase: Excellent office lead in any form, he said.
>
> 8 00:00:30.720 --&gt; 00:00:33.270 Michael Chase: That's an airplane and I need a lot
>
> 9 00:00:34.380 --&gt; 00:00:34.920 Michael Chase: It's just
>
> 10 00:00:36.180 --&gt; 00:00:37.170 Michael Chase: Recap program.
>
> 11 00:00:38.280 --&gt; 00:00:49.890 Michael Chase: And that if you Google doomsday plane and find on YouTube, all sorts of information about the say UK where they may och as it once was called
>
> 12 00:00:50.490 --&gt; 00:00:57.840 Michael Chase: And what that is is if if we do have a nuclear war and the United States bonds between specifically the Washington
>
> 13 00:00:58.770 --&gt; 00:01:12.210 Michael Chase: A key leaders of government would get on to see a plane and try to survive for 30 days and a Nuclear environment and would have to refuel and command and control of our nuclear forces here.
>
> 14 00:01:13.560 --&gt; 00:01:18.810 Next one is mission planning. That's really the how we task a photo bomber aircraft.
>
> 15 00:01:19.980 --&gt; 00:01:30.570 Michael Chase: To go hit targets. So it's throughout. They would take so that they can safely go in there void any enemy contact about their bombs and then come back. Excellent.
>
> 16 00:01:34.950 --&gt; 00:01:51.540 Steve beset leads FMS division and that everything that we can't fit in another division. That is what they fall in partner that was selling them stuff. So it's a command and control systems. It's radars. It's on to other stuff in the middle.
>
> 17 00:01:53.130 --&gt; 00:02:06.510 Michael Chase: Is a missile warning and defense folks that Peterson Air Force Base, which is in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and they work directly for an hour and not calm and now the Space Force.
>
> 18 00:02:07.920 --&gt; 00:02:16.950 Michael Chase: So if you haven't heard about the space for us hope you will. But we believe this division is actually going to move on with this resource so they look at
>
> 19 00:02:18.030 --&gt; 00:02:24.540 Michael Chase: A rate is a look. Some of our radars look up, we try to catalog everything and space to space.
>
> 20 00:02:25.650 --&gt; 00:02:32.790 Michael Chase: And try to track it. So we know whether some other nation launch something on, we try to figure out what it is.
>
> 21 00:02:34.080 --&gt; 00:02:37.110 Michael Chase: And also we try to avoid any collisions. Our
>
> 22 00:02:38.160 --&gt; 00:02:52.140 Michael Chase: Space acids and wax is just a big airplane with a big rainbow rainbow on top looks in the skies and it's basically you'll see radars at commercial
>
> 23 00:02:53.220 --&gt; 00:03:07.950 Airports that to go to see a rainbow out at swimming around that's looking for everything in the sky, trying to land friendly aircraft. It works does basically the same thing and tries to discern whether your craft a friendly.
>
> 24 00:03:10.290 --&gt; 00:03:12.540 New tool like commercial aircraft like
>
> 25 00:03:14.070 --&gt; 00:03:20.610 American Airlines or something like that. Anything that we cannot identify tries to go identify
>
> 26 00:03:22.020 --&gt; 00:03:30.810 Michael Chase: That one is headquartered in Tinker Air Force Base, which is Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We have folks at hands come in and Seattle, Washington.
>
> 27 00:03:31.950 --&gt; 00:03:43.500 Michael Chase: Bottom left and the Haines runs our force protection. So that's all our bases all the fence line cameras, those types of things to make sure that nobody's attacking our bases.
>
> 28 00:03:44.190 --&gt; 00:04:00.210 Michael Chase: And they also know heavy into Kona small UAS. So how can we detect the Phantom drones that are around and try to aspire to us was some that are in Ghana stand one cup kind of got bonds.
>
> 29 00:04:02.250 --&gt; 00:04:05.700 Michael Chase: We have a $5 billion program with Qatar.
>
> 30 00:04:06.900 --&gt; 00:04:18.810 Michael Chase: So what Chris help kind of Chris Ellis does in the middle bottom he he manages both Army Air Force Missile Defense Agency and other programs and make sure that they want.
>
> 31 00:04:21.150 --&gt; 00:04:24.450 And then out at Himalaya Force base, which is in Ogden, Utah.
>
> 32 00:04:25.590 --&gt; 00:04:26.970 Michael Chase: Very close to Salt Lake City.
>
> 33 00:04:28.110 --&gt; 00:04:33.600 Michael Chase: Is a combined Henson, and he runs a bunch of different things, mostly
>
> 34 00:04:35.190 --&gt; 00:04:45.600 Michael Chase: One of the key programs. That's not listed in our personal coaching command and control so anytime we lose an aircraft we we do everything we possibly can to
>
> 35 00:04:46.920 --&gt; 00:04:47.850 Rescue that pilot
>
> 36 00:04:49.110 --&gt; 00:05:00.300 And any of the crew and they have a thing called the beacon on them which they'll start emitting and so we can geo locate them. Think of that as the find my phone on your
>
> 37 00:05:03.210 --&gt; 00:05:03.630 Next slide.
>
> 38 00:05:10.590 --&gt; 00:05:13.650 One of the things we want to do is so we try to measure ourselves.
>
> 39 00:05:15.120 --&gt; 00:05:16.170 So we do
>
> 40 00:05:18.270 --&gt; 00:05:20.550 scoreboard so
>
> 41 00:05:21.780 --&gt; 00:05:30.120 Michael Chase: scoreboard to not leaders, putting out what they want done by a certain time. It's actually employees so would be you.
>
> 42 00:05:30.630 --&gt; 00:05:44.700 Michael Chase: Saying, Hey, I'm going to get this done by a certain date and time and then your score yourself. What we want to do is we don't want to know whether you pass to fail, we wanted to know, you know what was in your way. What can we knock down to make it go faster.
>
> 43 00:05:46.230 --&gt; 00:05:47.880 Michael Chase: And the reason for that is
>
> 44 00:05:48.960 --&gt; 00:05:56.910 We are losing our technical edge against China and Russia. We know that. And if we keep doing the same thing we've been doing for 30 years
>
> 45 00:05:57.390 --&gt; 00:06:10.800 We are not going to make up that difference. We've got to do something different. So we need young talent like you who have great ideas. We want you to do in any will block you run into. We want to know. That's what a scope or two about
>
> 46 00:06:11.850 --&gt; 00:06:12.210 Michael Chase: X.
>
> 47 00:06:15.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.430 And he has a couple quotes
>
> 48 00:06:18.930 --&gt; 00:06:30.810 Michael Chase: Basically said what I said if we do the same thing that we've been doing for 30 years, we're not going to get any better Einstein said that's what insanity is all about next.
>
> 49 00:06:34.890 --&gt; 00:06:46.620 Keep I think this adult. Okay, so this is do D 5000. This is how you start and finish a program and get it to the field.
>
> 50 00:06:47.730 --&gt; 00:06:49.500 extremely complicated.
>
> 51 00:06:51.210 --&gt; 00:06:57.600 multi year program. Now there's some programs that we must use this process to do
>
> 52 00:06:58.650 --&gt; 00:07:09.930 No doubt about that. But you can guarantee that it's not going to be done in anytime soon. And if you don't get a job with the Air Force, you're probably not going to go from left to right on a given
>
> 53 00:07:11.610 --&gt; 00:07:17.100 Is that would be a 20 or 30 year career. We're not doing that on many of our
>
> 54 00:07:18.840 --&gt; 00:07:19.200 Next,
>
> 55 00:07:24.450 --&gt; 00:07:24.810 Next,
>
> 56 00:07:27.600 --&gt; 00:07:28.560 So we are
>
> 57 00:07:29.670 --&gt; 00:07:34.140 Very much into innovation, doing things differently working outside the box.
>
> 58 00:07:35.520 --&gt; 00:07:42.240 Michael Chase: Typically previously, we would contract with a major defense industrial base contractors sense with the business.
>
> 59 00:07:43.590 --&gt; 00:07:47.730 And that would be things like not to go on and Boeing Lockheed Martin.
>
> 60 00:07:49.110 --&gt; 00:07:55.080 Michael Chase: Raytheon, those type of companies now we're dealing with a lot of startup companies lot of a
>
> 61 00:07:56.280 --&gt; 00:08:10.650 Michael Chase: Mom and pop stores, you know, please have 10 2040 people use organizations in the Department of Defense, like the defense digital service if its innovative nation University. The air force for good now.
>
> 62 00:08:12.510 --&gt; 00:08:20.670 Michael Chase: We've also delegate everything down the lowest level. So my boss doesn't make many decisions, it used to be. He made all the decisions, he's
>
> 63 00:08:21.120 --&gt; 00:08:31.950 Michael Chase: He's delegated almost everything he can, by law, down to the logo and that's intended to make us go fast. We're working with venture capitalists and startup companies.
>
> 64 00:08:32.640 --&gt; 00:08:45.150 Michael Chase: We use a lot of commercial tools automation machine learning a lot of new positions and we've got great support from the sector area for us, Chief of Staff, of course, the undersecretary innovation chief of staff.
>
> 65 00:08:46.170 --&gt; 00:08:46.560 Next,
>
> 66 00:08:50.850 --&gt; 00:08:51.210 Next,
>
> 67 00:08:54.030 --&gt; 00:09:02.100 Michael Chase: So, guess what, guess what one is also a debt 12 can be chassis and what you'll see is that same old factory building
>
> 68 00:09:03.000 --&gt; 00:09:21.360 Michael Chase: We originally started in out at Boston. We've new move to a couple locations in Boston's it right in the downtown right here. Everything people will have usually who were there have an apartment somewhere in Boston, they take the subway to go to work.
>
> 69 00:09:22.620 --&gt; 00:09:27.870 Michael Chase: It is typically a nine to five we throw everybody out. We don't want to work late
>
> 70 00:09:29.040 --&gt; 00:09:47.310 Michael Chase: No suits you work and T shirts and jeans and your code. Next one in the bottom right is actually Mr fussiness who's out at off it. He's got the same mindset. So he's doing one of those type facilities out in Omaha, Nebraska.
>
> 71 00:09:48.600 --&gt; 00:09:49.170 Excited.
>
> 72 00:09:52.710 --&gt; 00:09:54.660 Michael Chase: I think Glenn will bring up Glenn's going to solve.
>
> 73 00:09:56.580 --&gt; 00:10:00.120 These are a bunch of programs. I'm not going to go into a bunch of them.
>
> 74 00:10:01.470 --&gt; 00:10:09.300 I span is really our nuclear integrated strategic planning in nuclear fission planning and Connecticut.
>
> 75 00:10:12.240 --&gt; 00:10:13.440 Is chaos.
>
> 76 00:10:15.390 --&gt; 00:10:20.850 We do a lot with weather. Actually we do most of the weather. So we do have a high performance computer
>
> 77 00:10:22.140 --&gt; 00:10:28.860 very computationally oriented. So I've seen a bunch of computer engineers in that if you're interested in that we
>
> 78 00:10:30.150 --&gt; 00:10:34.260 Michael Chase: It is the fourth largest computer and in the world today.
>
> 79 00:10:35.310 --&gt; 00:10:41.700 We have it in Nebraska and we moved to Tennessee. So once classified in Washington classified
>
> 80 00:10:43.080 --&gt; 00:10:51.240 And what we do is not only collect all the words world's date weather data in content and try to do predictions.
>
> 81 00:10:51.930 --&gt; 00:11:05.580 What we're trying to do. It's different than the Weather Channel is we're trying to predict that some of our weapons use electric optics and infrared. Want to make sure they can see through clouds.
>
> 82 00:11:07.110 --&gt; 00:11:16.440 Michael Chase: In the density of the clouds. So it's not whether there's clouds and no clouds which is boolean, it's more of how thick other clouds and can we see
>
> 83 00:11:18.000 --&gt; 00:11:18.420 Excellent.
>
> 84 00:11:23.160 --&gt; 00:11:24.510 Is a number of the
>
> 85 00:11:25.800 --&gt; 00:11:30.180 Software factories that are going on, just like castle on in Boston.
>
> 86 00:11:31.350 --&gt; 00:11:34.650 Air Force has one in Montgomery now part of me.
>
> 87 00:11:35.670 --&gt; 00:11:53.610 Michael Chase: Glenn Townsend, who's going to speak. Next, he's to level up in San Antonio, the space of folks have one called Kobayashi Maru in Los Angeles in Colorado. Well, blue is ours. They're out it offered it for space in Omaha, Nebraska.
>
> 88 00:11:55.110 --&gt; 00:11:55.530 And then
>
> 89 00:11:57.510 --&gt; 00:12:09.750 Michael Chase: The software engineering groups each have their own software factory has been stood up right now ones in Ogden ones in which is a Utah ones in Macon, Georgia, and one is Oklahoma City.
>
> 90 00:12:13.290 --&gt; 00:12:21.570 Michael Chase: And what we're doing to that still bit different is normally we would contract out to industry to do our software and then
>
> 91 00:12:22.080 --&gt; 00:12:27.750 Michael Chase: He later they would come back and show us what they've got. We test it and we end up liking it.
>
> 92 00:12:28.650 --&gt; 00:12:38.550 Michael Chase: We've done that over and over and over again. So what we've now done is we've put organically lead mo coding teams. So that means we need you.
>
> 93 00:12:39.060 --&gt; 00:12:57.870 Michael Chase: To actually work on code and lead Conan teams with contractors with folks from universities with our federally funded research and development companies. So you would be leading one of those teams very early on in your career.
>
> 94 00:12:59.370 --&gt; 00:13:03.810 And that's how we're going to grow our software subject matter.
>
> 95 00:13:04.890 --&gt; 00:13:05.220 Expert
>
> 96 00:13:09.600 --&gt; 00:13:12.720 Michael Chase: I'm not gonna go to this next too complicated.
>
> 97 00:13:15.570 --&gt; 00:13:17.100 Michael Chase: Next, it's more bureaucracy.
>
> 98 00:13:19.290 --&gt; 00:13:22.320 Were also doing pitch days so that
>
> 99 00:13:23.610 --&gt; 00:13:30.840 Were a startup company would come in and say, Hey, I have an idea. I don't have any money, but I'd like to do X y&z
>
> 100 00:13:32.160 --&gt; 00:13:41.580 Michael Chase: Locked in the machine learning and artificial intelligence. Right. So what we did is we took about a bunch of our folks went down, Glenn did as well. Some of his folks.
>
> 101 00:13:42.060 --&gt; 00:13:53.670 Michael Chase: And we went down to New York City and we had a bunch of companies pitch to us and we had a government credit card and we put them on contract. I think for 25,000 or $75,000 we then need to get them going.
>
> 102 00:13:54.570 --&gt; 00:14:07.110 Michael Chase: And then later on. No pitch something to give us more as they will find their concept and we can fund them up to $750,000 and enforce a poem like EO digital
>
> 103 00:14:07.890 --&gt; 00:14:17.790 Michael Chase: Would give 750 K in the air force F works, which is a another organization Air Force would be 750 K so they didn't want to have a
>
> 104 00:14:19.020 --&gt; 00:14:34.800 Michael Chase: Pretty good idea and it's just, you know, they come up with a concept and it's not a requirement beast would say we need something actually come to us and say, hey, we have an idea. What do you think it will say, hey, we can use their next
>
> 105 00:14:40.230 --&gt; 00:14:48.120 These are a bunch of the companies, some will survive someone not with all great, great ideas next
>
> 106 00:14:54.810 --&gt; 00:14:56.700 I kind of went out to all that next.
>
> 107 00:15:00.570 --&gt; 00:15:13.710 Michael Chase: Big Data machine learning and artificial intelligence in the top left hand corner is a thing called Wisp and it's built by a very small company outside of the incoming air force base, they actually got their start with Mr.
>
> 108 00:15:15.000 --&gt; 00:15:31.650 Michael Chase: It MIT has a people works where they you work as a graduate student, if you're with MIT and you come up with an idea that you want to go do something, and this does actually ML at the pixel
>
> 109 00:15:33.000 --&gt; 00:15:33.390 Level.
>
> 110 00:15:34.590 --&gt; 00:15:42.570 Michael Chase: With a camera there. What we're using that for is we'd have a hard time with base defense rooms where
>
> 111 00:15:43.110 --&gt; 00:15:51.960 Michael Chase: You know, we want to know if somebody's trying to come into our fence line, you know, say I to house the thing that probably is coming over, over your fence, you want to know about that.
>
> 112 00:15:52.920 --&gt; 00:16:04.680 Michael Chase: But what happens is the cameras also keen on when that leaves dogs all those other things. This is a smart came this will actually tell you
>
> 113 00:16:05.340 --&gt; 00:16:18.060 Michael Chase: That it will learn over time that says you know that's that's one worry about it. That's, that's an animal. Don't worry about that. And if it is a human until you take him and whether that human is carrying a weapon or something.
>
> 114 00:16:19.830 --&gt; 00:16:25.230 Top right is globe who synthetic or radar what that's doing is that's trying to figure out
>
> 115 00:16:26.490 --&gt; 00:16:35.670 what the weather will be if we have no sense. So parts of the world like Kazakhstan and those parts of the world is no
>
> 116 00:16:36.780 --&gt; 00:16:47.940 Michael Chase: Weather radar or any weather instrumentation to tell us what it is. So this tries to predict what the weather is going to be. We have, we have no sensors.
>
> 117 00:16:49.320 --&gt; 00:17:00.240 A bottom left, you'll see that was the one I was talking about clouds, you know, you can see from a satellite or a and imagery that
>
> 118 00:17:01.440 --&gt; 00:17:08.100 Michael Chase: Is some obscure if obscuration in the top left hand corner. What we want to do is see how that how bad that is
>
> 119 00:17:08.610 --&gt; 00:17:15.090 Michael Chase: And whether we can actually put a bomb to that are not under we have to wait for Khloe weather and then Maven
>
> 120 00:17:15.990 --&gt; 00:17:35.760 Michael Chase: On the way it is a big program with the Department of Defense and that tries to allow us to do advanced artificial intelligence to link our Intel and ops, so that we can out decide what causes the actions we need to take at a moment's notice.
>
> 121 00:17:36.990 --&gt; 00:17:50.790 Very cool stuff. And that also takes a lot of feeds from what we call publicly available information which you would call. So social media, Facebook, Instagram, what's
>
> 122 00:17:52.170 --&gt; 00:17:52.590 Next, right.
>
> 123 00:17:57.240 --&gt; 00:18:03.450 So in some way appeal digital where I work. We're trying to lead the if what's in the adoption of secure Adam development.
>
> 124 00:18:04.560 --&gt; 00:18:21.150 Change processes for how we do contract requirements and test and our whole goal is to get something to operators in the field as quickly as possible. And even if the operator tells us they hate it. That tells us not to continue

> 125 00:18:22.590 --&gt; 00:18:40.920 Michael Chase: To often in the Department of Defense, we would keep going at it going at it, knowing that until more of your taxpayer money at a problem instead of just saying hey operators, just don't like this thing get rid of it. So we call that fail fast fail ideas. It's a little bit of code.
>
> 126 00:18:42.180 --&gt; 00:18:54.360 Michael Chase: Hardware out to the field, but the operators beat on it and tell us what they like about it. What they don't like about it and then we decide whether we could actually they decide within we should spend more money or just cancel it.
>
> 127 00:18:56.100 --&gt; 00:19:05.010 Michael Chase: We, we are very heavily. So any of your interview with data science majors, we need to, we want to wrestle
>
> 128 00:19:50.130 --&gt; 00:20:01.470 Michael Chase: Hey, so any of you out there watching this week. Do you have any questions for Mr. Cohn that we can push forward. If not, I even had one while watching your brief.
>
> 129 00:20:02.040 --&gt; 00:20:20.820 Michael Chase: And, you know, even from FMS is that spread across the different divisions or is that only utilize for your message. We've got to do the show if its mission planning in the mission planning division. We do have some in our
>
> 130 00:20:22.860 --&gt; 00:20:23.430 Michael Chase: Division
>
> 131 00:20:24.630 --&gt; 00:20:29.970 Michael Chase: Mainly, though many most of that money is in our FMS division.
>
> 132 00:20:31.170 --&gt; 00:20:43.320 Michael Chase: Two national earwax division. So we'll sell you can query a thing called wedge tail which the Australian truly took the wax model and advanced it a lot better than what we have today.
>
> 133 00:20:43.860 --&gt; 00:20:56.970 Michael Chase: And we're actually looking at I in that back from the Australians and in the books because they've taken what we add made it better. And rather than us developing we're really looking at
>
> 134 00:20:59.040 --&gt; 00:21:00.000 Verse F on us.
>
> 135 00:21:01.980 --&gt; 00:21:14.490 Steve Cohen from Robinson asked that is the pitch day for Shark Tank. And if you want to get a little bit more. Absolutely. Yeah, so the pitch days are exactly like Shark Tank.
>
> 136 00:21:15.180 --&gt; 00:21:25.590 Also we have things called mass challenge and Techstars and Techstars a worldwide same type of thing is venture capitalists who give a little bit of money to a company
>
> 137 00:21:26.310 --&gt; 00:21:36.540 The company has about 15 minutes to pitch what they have to move on. I've sent on a panel before. What a bunch of people
>
> 138 00:21:37.230 --&gt; 00:21:53.040 And then we decide, just like shop tab on TV. I then went on to invest in them or not. If not, they go away. Just like shopping, that's what today's and then there was a cluster from England, about the Air Force. They were funded erode ideas.
>
> 139 00:21:54.210 --&gt; 00:21:57.060 Yes, well we got the M in innovation, I
>
> 140 00:21:58.740 --&gt; 00:22:02.310 Am an innovation fund. I think it's called right, good job.
>
> 141 00:22:03.360 --&gt; 00:22:08.970 We've actually they send that out times toss in the field and say, what do you think about this.
>
> 142 00:22:10.230 --&gt; 00:22:19.230 Nine times out of 10 I say go for it. I mean, just try it out, you know, and it's cheaper part of money. I think it does. It doesn't come out of my pocket book.
>
> 143 00:22:21.210 --&gt; 00:22:28.860 Hey Sarah said, I do have a question. First of all, I am kind of disappointed that you use the scoreboard for Fenway Park, but I'll let that go.
>
> 144 00:22:30.150 --&gt; 00:22:39.870 But seriously, you mentioned something that I always try to use when I go recruit and is that we we provide our folks are young engineers like the audience.
>
> 145 00:22:40.560 --&gt; 00:22:48.750 The opportunity to lead at a young age. And you talked about that. So I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit about that. Oh, absolutely.
>
> 146 00:22:50.160 --&gt; 00:23:07.080 So, mainly in us, it's a little bit harder on things like radars and he planes. We really have to have a lot of experience to lead something because of the criticality of it, but mainly in software and data analytics and
>
> 147 00:23:08.160 --&gt; 00:23:11.700 Ml AI instrumentation, we
>
> 148 00:23:14.070 --&gt; 00:23:27.960 Us have another generation, a lost. And believe it or not, most of us recognize that fact. And so we will put you in charge and let you go on a team, see how you do.
>
> 149 00:23:29.370 --&gt; 00:23:30.240 Absolutely.
>
> 150 00:23:32.190 --&gt; 00:23:32.880 Well, for
>
> 151 00:23:35.070 --&gt; 00:23:41.220 A Steve probably the last question before you go. Well, one of the questions was, can you talk about some of the innovation that's come out a pitch days.
>
> 152 00:23:42.540 --&gt; 00:23:42.750 Maybe
>
> 153 00:23:44.940 --&gt; 00:23:48.180 Yeah, so, uh, so out of pitch days.
>
> 154 00:23:51.510 --&gt; 00:23:54.480 We've got a few things going on.
>
> 155 00:23:56.520 --&gt; 00:24:20.790 One is using small UAB to do calibration on stone Instrument Landing systems in traffic systems, one in the cyber realm. When looking at a thing called Pico because segmentation, which works at the sub application layer. So if you look at the OSI stack it would be layered eight
>
> 156 00:24:23.040 --&gt; 00:24:26.910 Is one that's also cyber related that looks at
>
> 157 00:24:27.960 --&gt; 00:24:31.410 Detecting vulnerabilities and automatically actually knows
>
> 158 00:24:32.490 --&gt; 00:24:34.980 We have one that says self healing radar.
>
> 159 00:24:36.090 --&gt; 00:24:47.670 We have one that's actually a power generation one that is not using batteries or turbine and I forget how it's actually been done but it's
>
> 160 00:24:49.500 --&gt; 00:24:56.790 That and then no one last one is it taking the technology for or autonomous vehicles.
>
> 161 00:24:58.380 --&gt; 00:25:06.510 And the radar technology that they use it to do that, to allow us to do multi band multi sensing radars.
>
> 162 00:25:08.190 --&gt; 00:25:14.550 Cool. All right, thank you. I know you've gotta run. So thank you very much for this and for great rundown on PTO digital
>
> 163 00:25:15.150 --&gt; 00:25:31.140 I'm going to turn it over to Glenn Townson next Glenn is the director of engineering for the command control communications intelligence and networks Directorate. So glad audio and like Steve mentioned earlier, Glenn and I and Raul kind of work together for the last several years, so
>
> 164 00:25:35.370 --&gt; 00:25:42.240 Good morning and welcome everybody to see such a larger number of folks that are interested in our mission in the Air Force.
>
> 165 00:25:43.920 --&gt; 00:25:54.060 So just a brief history of myself. I am not former military I'm like yourself. I started as a civilian as a GS seven back in 1986 on dating myself.
>
> 166 00:25:55.320 --&gt; 00:26:03.330 Michael Chase: I did work my way up through and through the civil service ranks to become the Director of Engineering here at sheath, Ryan.
>
> 167 00:26:03.870 --&gt; 00:26:18.270 Michael Chase: I took a hiatus in the middle, just to go out and get some experience in the private sector. So I went to work for a company called Nortel Networks right around 2000 and and I spent some time, about eight years I as Steve mentioned earlier.
>
> 168 00:26:18.270 --&gt; 00:26:26.790 Michael Chase: Supporting the Air Force in a in a yes role, which is a contracted engineering support back to the Air Force and rejoin the Air Force.
>
> 169 00:26:26.790 --&gt; 00:26:31.890 Michael Chase: And in 2009 and I've been in my current position for about five years now.
>
> 170 00:26:33.390 --&gt; 00:26:41.190 Mr. Bradley said I am the director of engineering know the command control communications intelligence and networks Directorate at Hanscom and
>
> 171 00:26:41.490 --&gt; 00:26:50.790 I'm just going to run you through a couple of slides up front. I apologize if you've seen the content before we're dishing again. I know you guys have been getting a whole bunch of presentations about our mission.
>
> 172 00:26:51.480 --&gt; 00:26:57.840 Within the force, but I just wanted to put in perspective as we go through this, what what it means to work for a match com
>
> 173 00:26:58.860 --&gt; 00:27:01.920 Center. And then within a fee. So, next slide please.
>
> 174 00:27:05.130 --&gt; 00:27:06.150 So, this is this is
>
> 175 00:27:07.320 --&gt; 00:27:14.460 Michael Chase: A snapshot a high level overview of the course material command. So within the, within the airport's there are multiple commands.
>
> 176 00:27:15.180 --&gt; 00:27:24.750 Michael Chase: The acquisition for us, for the most part works within the course material command and within the course material command is this six centers.
>
> 177 00:27:25.140 --&gt; 00:27:40.410 Michael Chase: And they'll listed here, as Mr Bradley mentioned earlier, and Steve might have mentioned earlier, we work within the lifecycle management center which is headquartered out at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, and they have multiple locations throughout the US.
>
> 178 00:27:41.760 --&gt; 00:27:42.630 So slide please.
>
> 179 00:27:45.210 --&gt; 00:27:51.540 Michael Chase: So this is a snapshot of the leadership team within, within the Air Force lifecycle management.
>
> 180 00:27:52.710 --&gt; 00:27:59.130 Michael Chase: So there's two things that you from an acquire his perspective, and I believe the majority of folks would be working in the
>
> 181 00:27:59.490 --&gt; 00:28:04.890 Michael Chase: Acquisition career field. If you were to join the Airforce following your fee shift from phone you're on.
>
> 182 00:28:05.520 --&gt; 00:28:14.670 Michael Chase: graduations from ma here respective colleges so from day to day operations we work for a gentleman called a doctor will refer
>
> 183 00:28:15.090 --&gt; 00:28:24.780 Michael Chase: Each FAQ, so Dr rover are hugely Steve mentioned innovation over and over again so he really changed the culture on. He's a senior acquisition executive
>
> 184 00:28:25.200 --&gt; 00:28:35.250 Michael Chase: A big brain innovative thinker really moving the Air Force way from the monolithic large just combine it into more agile quicker.
>
> 185 00:28:35.670 --&gt; 00:28:51.870 Michael Chase: Technology based on decisions and technology patient acquisition strategies getting capability to the field worker basically is what you know Dr. Rose is all about. So when we speak up iOS or Program Executive Officers
>
> 186 00:28:53.580 --&gt; 00:29:02.010 When you talk about acquisition, who gives you the authority to go sign a contract that all flows through the CEO Lifecycle Management Center, which is
>
> 187 00:29:03.870 --&gt; 00:29:15.570 The default chat. Right. Pat are organized train, equip so we have two bosses basically within acquisition one for this trip. You know what systems we buy and how we're going to contract those systems.
>
> 188 00:29:15.780 --&gt; 00:29:24.150 And what strategies. We're going to implement it to get out the fielding those capabilities conference that's FAQ, you know, we'll, we'll get our training where we get the
>
> 189 00:29:25.140 --&gt; 00:29:41.940 All our funding for our facilities, all the things that we need to do our day to day job in the direction comes from the lifecycle management on a moderate right path within within Lifecycle Management Center. This 12 years I worked for General Tony Schmidt.
>
> 190 00:29:43.140 --&gt; 00:29:49.590 He's awesome. He's probably the best boss and I've had many, many, many good bosses, as far as the CEO goes
>
> 191 00:29:50.100 --&gt; 00:29:57.570 General Schmidt is really a full width leaner as far as innovation and breaking down barriers to get things delivered or the Wafa warfighter
>
> 192 00:29:57.960 --&gt; 00:30:02.700 So he's he's young he's shown here. And Steve mentioned he works in digital. So the
>
> 193 00:30:03.210 --&gt; 00:30:10.560 Third Thursday off from the left on the top calm is the word is digital but just to give you a perspective, each one of these CEOs.
>
> 194 00:30:11.100 --&gt; 00:30:24.840 Within the lifecycle management center and there's be those that are in the lifecycle management center, but each one of these CEOs, you can think of is in private industries like a president or CEO or vice president of a business unit.
>
> 195 00:30:25.920 --&gt; 00:30:33.090 So within see three iron in French and journal Schmidt has it's above them you know 4000 people working for him.
>
> 196 00:30:33.570 --&gt; 00:30:41.190 So if you think corporate wise, it's a it's a pretty decent sized you know medium sized corporation that each one of these leaders.
>
> 197 00:30:41.880 --&gt; 00:30:50.250 Leads in the acquisition for the worse. And that's pretty much the same throughout the all the CEOs directors on the right.
>
> 198 00:30:51.090 --&gt; 00:31:00.600 So each one of the CEOs and gentlemen, Mario. Who's the leader up an LLC. PMC are three star general has a staff of people
>
> 199 00:31:01.410 --&gt; 00:31:09.360 In the various functions that support their mission. So you know I know we're, we're in the engineering field here this morning show pictured here is
>
> 200 00:31:09.990 --&gt; 00:31:20.790 A Mr. Fisher. He's the LLC. PMC senior functional for engineering and Mr Bradley is, is basically his deputy, or associate your hands on.
>
> 201 00:31:21.510 --&gt; 00:31:36.870 Mr. Fisher is an FCS and he again on just manages the engineering career field across all of the center and support on Jerome with marine the day to day you know operations of the lifecycle management center.
>
> 202 00:31:38.310 --&gt; 00:31:47.790 So, from where I said it's a little confusing. So I work directly for general Schmidt, like Mr. Fisher is my senior functional lead are so when I have engineering
>
> 203 00:31:48.120 --&gt; 00:32:00.870 Issues questions, concerns, I need help on the training I need something you know something asked or answered for, you know, my workforce. I go to Mr. Fisher and he gives me the the sport direction.
>
> 204 00:32:01.260 --&gt; 00:32:06.420 And advice that I need to execute my mission as the director of engineering within the, within the the
>
> 205 00:32:07.980 --&gt; 00:32:15.300 So that's just a kind of a quick overview. Again, the POS think business units think lines of, you know, lines of effort.
>
> 206 00:32:15.570 --&gt; 00:32:25.050 They the workforce. The mission of acquisition is carved up by capability. So within see three i and then we we deliver that connects the networks.
>
> 207 00:32:25.410 --&gt; 00:32:42.960 Are the data links the cloud computing everything that we, the Air Force need to enable the warfighter to to to execute the mission from an infrastructure network communications type vision is done, honestly. Three, I'm in the next slide please.
>
> 208 00:32:45.870 --&gt; 00:32:54.810 Michael Chase: This is the so we started with a FMC talked about LLC. PMC. So this is what a snapshot looks like within a P. O. This is General Schmidt.
>
> 209 00:32:55.410 --&gt; 00:33:01.200 Michael Chase: Issue. And at the bottom. The always, you know, he never puts himself at the top of the pyramid, which I think it's really cool.
>
> 210 00:33:02.160 --&gt; 00:33:09.660 Michael Chase: Visual look is himself has, you know, top down and bottom up to always for him a little bit about that discussion earlier about putting on
>
> 211 00:33:10.080 --&gt; 00:33:20.250 Michael Chase: The younger generation or say that then new college graduates and on the on the front lines, giving them more responsibility. Give them them permission to go execute
>
> 212 00:33:20.880 --&gt; 00:33:30.150 Michael Chase: Especially girl Schmitz philosophy from, you know, across the organization. He does not force things from the top. He expects things to
>
> 213 00:33:30.630 --&gt; 00:33:40.980 Michael Chase: Evolve from the you know the lower levels up and that's how he he draw. He likes to draw his your chart here. So again, each one of these functions represented here.
>
> 214 00:33:41.940 --&gt; 00:33:52.830 Michael Chase: You know, Steve. Once you reach one of the they do such as a kernel level within the children, and we have four directors, so that second line down. Are the SMS at work directly for
>
> 215 00:33:53.340 --&gt; 00:33:59.520 Michael Chase: General Schmidt, the two above in green and blue on the there's two different organizations.
>
> 216 00:34:00.180 --&gt; 00:34:10.110 Michael Chase: That are in on p Yoshi thrown in, but support our mission. So those essentials are covered our color differently because of who they are, report to from a CEO.
>
> 217 00:34:10.860 --&gt; 00:34:20.310 Michael Chase: Perspective then below the XML CRC all of the options and the most of the functional represented here were represented on the Mc, Mc so
>
> 218 00:34:20.940 --&gt; 00:34:35.880 Michael Chase: Remember correctly the LLC empty chair functional I mentioned miss the feature on here, you'll see that you know on the director of engineering. So on the engineering lead or for V oc dryness and then we have the equivalent across all the other functions.
>
> 219 00:34:39.000 --&gt; 00:34:48.210 And again, that is the two folks that German Schmidt work for identified here is john Roper on our doctor Roadrunner. Right. And I don't know, Mario on the left.
>
> 220 00:34:49.650 --&gt; 00:34:50.190 By please
>
> 221 00:34:53.730 --&gt; 00:35:02.460 Just a little bit of a quick snapshot of, you know, what we are, what we do within sheath Ryan and the stuff on the left, this is probably not so
>
> 222 00:35:03.030 --&gt; 00:35:14.130 So important to you, but it's a slide the general shape us and stuff district describe to you know our mission to folks outside the Air Force like the governor of Massachusetts, just to give an idea of
>
> 223 00:35:14.970 --&gt; 00:35:26.700 The type of contracts, we have our missionaries are are on the top right on. As you can see a lot of it is in the connects infrastructure and the
>
> 224 00:35:27.480 --&gt; 00:35:36.990 Call it data center side. So we do a lot of it. So if you think over you know the internet. If you think of variety. Think of Comcast, you think of
>
> 225 00:35:37.740 --&gt; 00:35:46.440 Sprint and what they provide for you as a homeowner through, whether it's Wi Fi, whether it's your, you know, your cable TV. Well, whether it's your
>
> 226 00:35:47.730 --&gt; 00:35:56.130 Just your networking. In general, we provide that for all of the Air Force. So the Air Force as a massive you know there's about
>
> 227 00:35:57.570 --&gt; 00:36:09.300 500,000 people that support the Air Force on the day to day basis. And that's probably low, it probably closest 600,000 us to look at all the contractors and whatnot that support our mission.
>
> 228 00:36:09.810 --&gt; 00:36:20.730 So we provide all of that infrastructure, whether it's, you know, on a base or whether it's in a forward deployed location, you know, on Afghanistan or, you know, in Europe.
>
> 229 00:36:21.240 --&gt; 00:36:35.070 Or wherever our troops are our organization provides all of the infrastructure that they need to execute their mission, regardless of where they are 24 724 hours a day, seven days a week.
>
> 230 00:36:35.700 --&gt; 00:36:47.160 On top of that, we you know we provide the services. So it services. So think email think things like the WebEx thing. It's like teams things on, you know, Skype,
>
> 231 00:36:47.610 --&gt; 00:36:56.940 All of the the collaborative type tools that you may be familiar with zoom you're familiar with a new college experience. Your, your private life.
>
> 232 00:36:57.300 --&gt; 00:37:03.240 We provide that in a secure manner to the work to the warfighter and the reason why we have to, you know,
>
> 233 00:37:03.810 --&gt; 00:37:11.400 Provide all that unique and outside work commercial does is because of security to everything we do is on on on large
>
> 234 00:37:11.880 --&gt; 00:37:20.520 Private Network, if you will. And again, if you think about the size of it right it's 500,000 to 600,000 active users.
>
> 235 00:37:21.030 --&gt; 00:37:35.460 Across the globe, and we need to provide that regardless of, you know, what our advertisers to do are doing in cyberspace or or even chemically and taking off location. So, so it's a very complex infrastructure that we provide.
>
> 236 00:37:36.330 --&gt; 00:37:42.900 One of the cool things that we do on offensive and defensive cyber so you hear all the time, you know,
>
> 237 00:37:43.680 --&gt; 00:37:56.700 His adversaries, you know, trying to hack in and wreak havoc with our you know presidential elections or, you know, stealing information from various parts of government or corporations in in the US.

> 238 00:37:57.840 --&gt; 00:38:03.120 What we do with them. See, manage, we provide that. Yeah, the operators are 16 the Air Force.
>
> 239 00:38:03.510 --&gt; 00:38:17.610 Or defenders, if you will, on for the word none of the Air Force, but for with a nation against those attacks. We provide those those individuals with both the tools they need to detect one that were necessary is trying to
>
> 240 00:38:18.090 --&gt; 00:38:34.620 Do something nefarious to our to our network to our infrastructure and then to we provide them the tools to counter that attack. So it's a, it's a, it's a pretty cool mission on to to growing mission. So Peter engineers who really enjoy any engineering
>
> 241 00:38:36.120 --&gt; 00:38:53.130 Discipline. If you have a you know, a desire to get into cyber on and we have the the workforce and the need for it through your skills on on you know in high demand within our portfolio, the offensive side so you know
>
> 242 00:38:54.480 --&gt; 00:38:59.490 Lately, where a military organizations or soccer is in your warfighting domain as a space.
>
> 243 00:39:00.510 --&gt; 00:39:07.620 There are a lot of space today because space forces you know about probably five to 10 years ago and we stood up cyber command.
>
> 244 00:39:08.100 --&gt; 00:39:18.240 Started looking at, you know, cyber spaces as a domain where, you know, we knew we had to be active for or, you know, in case of of war.
>
> 245 00:39:19.050 --&gt; 00:39:24.720 So so offensive cyber when our passive, you know, you hear a lot about what our adversaries are doing
>
> 246 00:39:25.140 --&gt; 00:39:35.550 We provide the tools and capabilities to the cyber warfighter to be able to do similar activities or nefarious actions against our adversaries.
>
> 247 00:39:36.480 --&gt; 00:39:53.070 So it's, again, really cool mission on I can't really speak a lot about on the offensive side because a lot of it gets classified pretty quick, but just know that you know where you know you hit one side of the news on the, you know, we're, we are an active Air Force in offensive cyber
>
> 248 00:39:54.870 --&gt; 00:40:01.740 Trying to combine that Connecticut nine kinetic effects in a warfighting capability and time.
>
> 249 00:40:02.820 --&gt; 00:40:15.180 Other things to talk about crypto. We do have all the encryption for Natalie Air Force, but a lot of the NSA and the arm and what they provide for the nation, our guys down at Antonio on to all of the
>
> 250 00:40:15.990 --&gt; 00:40:33.270 Crypto show all everything that it takes to encrypt all our data links all our infrastructure all our messaging all our capability in a highly contested environment from Java San Antonio, Texas, where that is, you know, undersea three iron and cloud infrastructure where we're
>
> 251 00:40:34.530 --&gt; 00:40:44.760 With the leaders. We are responsible to provide club again private cloud and on capability in both Amazon unless you're looking to move to other
>
> 252 00:40:45.090 --&gt; 00:40:51.630 private clouds. There's a lot of activity going on with moving the Air Force and all of them and that type of structure.
>
> 253 00:40:52.080 --&gt; 00:41:03.480 Practical area networks, think of things like if you're going to have 35 and we do F 1635 Steve mentioned a wax all of those aircraft when they're flying this platforms, when they're flying
>
> 254 00:41:03.900 --&gt; 00:41:13.410 The collecting information to getting information they need to share that information not only with other aircraft in the area. But back to the mainland to our sheet to centers with a
>
> 255 00:41:13.740 --&gt; 00:41:30.030 You know command and control of the wars being done on being on being created. That's all done through tactical area networks and satellite connections, but but that's satellite your outer space, but our division here and he has can provide all those unique
>
> 256 00:41:31.200 --&gt; 00:41:41.550 Michael Chase: Data networks to support the movement of information from from offline platform, if you will. Special Projects can't really speak a lot about that. That's all classified stuff.
>
> 257 00:41:42.300 --&gt; 00:41:59.340 Michael Chase: But it's really the, you know, special sauce. If you will have some rich really cool from a technology perspective, but a lot of it and it gets to be quote unquote special is because of the mission and or the customer that we're trying to let it get into those higher classified levels.
>
> 258 00:42:00.780 --&gt; 00:42:10.860 And again, really can't speak to that at all. SEC ops Steve mentioned Kessel Run. We do have, we have level up on. We have a thing called a
>
> 259 00:42:11.310 --&gt; 00:42:28.170 Platform one and in similar capsule run that's, you know, the mission is to really get after agile software development and moving towards you know getting a technology drops or capability drops to the warfighter on a monthly basis versus a year to year to year basis when
>
> 260 00:42:30.630 --&gt; 00:42:41.280 Michael Chase: You're the puzzles, the pies below just show a little bit about the organization, we, we have about 12 billion over five years left the total number of dollars that we execute
>
> 261 00:42:41.670 --&gt; 00:42:49.260 Michael Chase: Pretty big numbers. I know, it's crazy on you think of business. If you're, you know, if you had a business and you could get a budget of $12 billion.
>
> 262 00:42:49.560 --&gt; 00:42:58.200 Michael Chase: And again, this is only one p. Oh there's 12 of us will do is just within LLC. PMC see think, you know, just think of the money in the budget that the
>
> 263 00:42:59.130 --&gt; 00:43:11.520 Michael Chase: Government's putting towards defending the nation. It's, it's pretty crazy. But it's also, you know, to require it's good to shake and we'll get into you know really where the money's going, but it's a pretty big budget.
>
> 264 00:43:12.660 --&gt; 00:43:22.410 On contract wise on the, on the right. So we get, we have about $12 billion and today we have it's roughly. I think if you do the math, a to do public math.
>
> 265 00:43:23.130 --&gt; 00:43:34.560 I think it's about 1600 contracts that were supporting so that's that's that's a lot of contracts. Right. So if you think about, you know, as I said, we have about three to 4000
>
> 266 00:43:35.100 --&gt; 00:43:49.890 People with his teacher and of that there's probably about 400 civil service engineers and another 400 and our contract engineer says about 800 engineers that are supporting activity on about 1600 contracts.
>
> 267 00:43:50.730 --&gt; 00:44:12.060 Again, it's so it's busy. It's good. It's the first on network, you know, the work we do is if you like technology if you like data says if you like on infrastructure, whether it's cloud computing or, you know, networking cyber related activities offensive, the SEC defensive he or she behind
>
> 268 00:44:13.560 --&gt; 00:44:14.490 Next slide please.
>
> 269 00:44:18.390 --&gt; 00:44:27.240 These are our mission areas. And so we have four major on divisions. So back on that org chart a few slides ago they were formed on
>
> 270 00:44:27.990 --&gt; 00:44:33.390 System materially, these are kernels that lead divisions and this is how much broken off on
>
> 271 00:44:34.020 --&gt; 00:44:46.170 Or don't want cyber the things that they work on our you know I mentioned the space crypto here, here, and ground crypto server. Every, everything that communicate is encrypted within you know that's that's what keeps it safe.
>
> 272 00:44:46.890 --&gt; 00:44:57.750 insecure and it makes it difficult for our adversaries, the hack into all of those crypto devices are are engineered, if you will, design down at San Antonio.
>
> 273 00:44:58.500 --&gt; 00:45:11.190 Texas, which is a division under ourselves here enhance them on the joint soccer sheet to and unified platform. So those are the programs that are getting after the offensive and defensive cyber
>
> 274 00:45:12.210 --&gt; 00:45:20.460 So, you know, the command and control of the joint cyber workforces is a massive undertaking, because you have an Army, Navy, Air Force.
>
> 275 00:45:21.780 --&gt; 00:45:26.070 postcard and others that are doing an operating in cyberspace.
>
> 276 00:45:26.580 --&gt; 00:45:36.930 So the, you know, when you get up to cyber command which is unified command trying to to control command and control who's doing what, what tools do I have available to me.
>
> 277 00:45:37.350 --&gt; 00:45:51.000 Is is a difficult task. Don't cyber see to program are those are the team that are putting together the platform to help our, our leaders are decision makers manage that that that domain.
>
> 278 00:45:52.140 --&gt; 00:45:59.070 To understand what you know what again what tools are available and and what assets are you know are going after whatever's every in
>
> 279 00:45:59.610 --&gt; 00:46:08.550 Defending what unified platform. That's the program that's providing the tools and capabilities for both defensive and offensive cyber
>
> 280 00:46:09.420 --&gt; 00:46:15.990 And under that is where you'll find that the software factory have a level up in the
>
> 281 00:46:16.980 --&gt; 00:46:30.510 Platform platform, one which which is STD rates very show. I'm not going to go into detail there because they did a great job with a capsule run, but it is commercial practices getting after delivering on
>
> 282 00:46:31.590 --&gt; 00:46:35.550 military capability as Steve pointed out, if the
>
> 283 00:46:37.290 --&gt; 00:46:49.680 Michael Chase: Person, if you will, to people. That was our captain Julie that that lead that effort. So captain's, you know, just put in perspective. Steve mentioned, you know, empowering you know the
>
> 284 00:46:50.220 --&gt; 00:47:00.180 Michael Chase: Next generation of leaders on the back ends are probably around, I'd say between 2032 years old, they have about you know roughly six to
>
> 285 00:47:00.540 --&gt; 00:47:15.960 Michael Chase: Nine years of experience within the VOD we had two captains, that, that one was an engineer and one was a program procurement officer. So when did the contracting or leaning on how to do agile and contracting and
>
> 286 00:47:17.190 --&gt; 00:47:28.380 And Captain Austin Brian is a computer scientists who just was the lead in in standing up that organization. So again, empower the youth empowering young
>
> 287 00:47:28.890 --&gt; 00:47:41.160 The younger generation folks that really understand the technology mother cool stuff. They do down there. The that black label tag is the same thing. I just discussed with the up in level lot but it's done enough
>
> 288 00:47:42.210 --&gt; 00:47:58.200 highly classified environment so we we have mirror images of what we're doing in downtown San Antonio and a Boston but Antonio y'all also have been our scripts, which are secure work environments on days we have the same capabilities 14 that mission.
>
> 289 00:47:59.460 --&gt; 00:48:10.380 They do for military shields. Okay. Moving over to the aerial networks, a lot of cool capability going on there. Couple aircraft. We have replied, the baking aircraft and we do the
>
> 290 00:48:11.580 --&gt; 00:48:24.540 Global Hawk both those are officially gateways. So you're here in Afghanistan. There's actually movies that have been made, where we had troops up on mountains are on the other side amount that could support because they couldn't communicate that
>
> 291 01:04:29.760 --&gt; 01:04:37.860 Michael Chase: Was electrical engineering, then my post grad education and nuclear engineering. I was a chief engineer on nuke subs for number of years.
>
> 292 01:04:38.850 --&gt; 01:04:49.950 Michael Chase: Resigned my my commission and then went into industry for number of years when we were industry was moving, you know, from time division multiplex to to IP and the convergence of voice and data.
>
> 293 01:04:50.640 --&gt; 01:05:06.420 Michael Chase: I got into helping companies design. The there and build their data centers and so forth. So I did that for a number of years, came back to the Air Force in 2009 and and as as an engineer on the pursuing the nuclear mission.
>
> 294 01:05:08.190 --&gt; 01:05:13.380 So I just, that's just a little bit of my background. I've been doing that since 2009, as I said,
>
> 295 01:05:14.130 --&gt; 01:05:21.210 You know, one of the challenges I had, I spent a lot of time on classified networks doing classified things because of the nuclear mission and
>
> 296 01:05:21.750 --&gt; 01:05:30.090 One of the challenges was putting a briefing together that I could share on an unclassified forum. I'd like to tell you a lot more stuff that
>
> 297 01:05:30.930 --&gt; 01:05:38.880 That is classified. But then I'd have to kill you. And that kind of defeats the purpose of trying to recruit you so I'll go ahead and keep this unclassified
>
> 298 01:05:40.650 --&gt; 01:05:46.650 Michael Chase: You know, I, I, kind of, I'm flipping the script a little bit. You've seen some organizational charts in that I want to talk
>
> 299 01:05:46.980 --&gt; 01:05:56.610 Michael Chase: More about the mission up front, and I get some organizational things and where where I think you might be able to fit in towards the back end of the brief, but I did.
>
> 300 01:05:57.450 --&gt; 01:06:02.280 Michael Chase: Want to specifically mentioned, I'm going to use an analogy, this young person.
>
> 301 01:06:03.030 --&gt; 01:06:11.520 Michael Chase: Was walking by and he saw a bunch of bunch of bricklayers land laying brick and building something and he went up to one of them and said, so what do you, what are you doing
>
> 302 01:06:12.060 --&gt; 01:06:20.670 Michael Chase: He said, Well, I'm, I'm just slinging mud and laying bricks and same old, same old every day and he goes on. Okay.
>
> 303 01:06:21.300 --&gt; 01:06:26.640 Michael Chase: And walks walks a little bit further down and he asked this guy doing the exact same job. He said, What are you doing,
>
> 304 01:06:27.360 --&gt; 01:06:38.460 Michael Chase: He said, Oh, well, I'm a member of a team that's building the most beautiful Cathedral, that the world will have ever seen. It's going to be famous people are going to come from all over the world.
>
> 305 01:06:38.910 --&gt; 01:06:57.630 Michael Chase: To see this, it's going to be a all inspiring incredible accomplishment and and so here's here's two people doing the same kind of work, but which one of them, you think has the more job satisfaction. You know, it's an easy call. And so I think as you're making career choices.
>
> 306 01:06:58.950 --&gt; 01:07:07.080 What you want to do the engineering disciplines that you're in. And some of you probably want to look in and pursue cross discipline work that
>
> 307 01:07:07.800 --&gt; 01:07:15.000 Understand, or being part of something bigger than just doing a job or punching a time clock or putting your hours and
>
> 308 01:07:15.330 --&gt; 01:07:23.700 I think is really important when you're making your career choices. So I want to talk about the nuclear mission and and how this is different than just
>
> 309 01:07:24.390 --&gt; 01:07:28.470 You know, maybe just a standard industry job that you might do and
>
> 310 01:07:29.040 --&gt; 01:07:41.700 There's nothing wrong. We need a lot of people working for the industry to not necessarily just for the federal government in the god but this just has a particular draw. I think that this is going to be appealing to some of you. Next slide please.
>
> 311 01:07:44.070 --&gt; 01:07:55.380 This is gonna. This is kind of the mission at a glance. This is a nuclear mission NC three nuclear command and control communications as a part of that. I'm going to show you how that fits in.
>
> 312 01:07:56.040 --&gt; 01:08:07.080 But you'll see across the top delivering nuclear capabilities more fighters use every day to deter and assure and I just want to be clear and describe what that means, because the
>
> 313 01:08:07.920 --&gt; 01:08:16.920 The reason that we have and maintain a nuclear stockpile and very capable nuclear weapons and command and control over those is so that we never have to use them.
>
> 314 01:08:18.750 --&gt; 01:08:27.960 The whole point of having these is that our adversaries know that we have them and that we're ready, willing and able to use them so that we never have to
>
> 315 01:08:28.470 --&gt; 01:08:38.040 And that determines, you know, we're trying to determine warfare. Ever since the creation of nuclear weapons, the number of people that have been killed and worldwide conflicts.
>
> 316 01:08:39.060 --&gt; 01:08:49.110 Has dropped dramatically because nuclear weapons are there and haven't had to be used. The assure part is to prevent proliferation that we assure our, our
>
> 317 01:08:49.980 --&gt; 01:09:02.280 Allies that we will provide you know nuclear weapons support for them so they don't have to develop their, you know, their own nuclear arsenal. So that's what the determine assure apart right now. This is a
>
> 318 01:09:03.300 --&gt; 01:09:12.900 Michael Chase: You heard some of the other speakers talk about it. But we're recapitalizing this entire area so that that middle picture is supposed to show you a try at the bottom part is
>
> 319 01:09:13.200 --&gt; 01:09:17.820 Michael Chase: blocked out because that's the Navy piece that's nuclear subs with nuclear missiles on there.
>
> 320 01:09:18.150 --&gt; 01:09:26.370 Michael Chase: The other two piece. We've got on the left, the Intercontinental ballistic missiles that ground delivered nuclear weapons capabilities and on the right, the air delivered
>
> 321 01:09:26.700 --&gt; 01:09:35.460 Michael Chase: So our strategic bombers as it can carry a nuclear weapons on those. And that's what's traditionally called the nuclear triad, and not the ICBM are
>
> 322 01:09:36.390 --&gt; 01:09:51.570 Michael Chase: We've got over four or 400 of these on alert accordance with treaty and these are in missile fields up in the north northern Midwest. We've got three missile fields, one of just one of them is the size of the State of Connecticut and enormous
>
> 323 01:09:52.860 --&gt; 01:09:59.010 Area that's with underground missiles in it and we're recapitalizing were designing and building whole new
>
> 324 01:09:59.820 --&gt; 01:10:11.160 Weapon weapon system across the board. You can see that it's hard to tell. And that little picture weapon system command and control, but the command and control systems for these are actually buried underground
>
> 325 01:10:11.820 --&gt; 01:10:19.650 In capsules and very cool to go in and and see what they do there. I've actually been crawled inside some of these
>
> 326 01:10:19.920 --&gt; 01:10:25.920 missile silos that are underground and the missile command and control centers. We do believe in our engineering workforce.
>
> 327 01:10:26.340 --&gt; 01:10:34.230 That in order for us to design a effectively design and build and deliver next generation capabilities and all these areas.
>
> 328 01:10:34.560 --&gt; 01:10:43.230 That we've got to go out and visit these sites and talk to the people that operate them and understand what their challenges are and what they would like to see different
>
> 329 01:10:43.620 --&gt; 01:10:54.960 And so it's great to have a chance to go out and see some of these. So we're building a whole new weapon system. This is under new weapon system on the right, we're building new strategic bombers and new kind of weapons that they
>
> 330 01:10:55.830 --&gt; 01:11:04.590 They deliver stand off both gravity bombs and cruise missiles that are that are nuclear capable and then the piece that I'm going to
>
> 331 01:11:05.730 --&gt; 01:11:12.780 Focus on is great at the kind of the middle top nuclear command control and communications integration.
>
> 332 01:11:13.920 --&gt; 01:11:19.410 Our, our kind of motto is no calm no bomb and that means no nuclear deterrence.
>
> 333 01:11:20.790 --&gt; 01:11:26.010 Traditional warfare going back, way, way long before nuclear weapons is
>
> 334 01:11:27.150 --&gt; 01:11:36.960 decapitation if you can take out the command and control if you can take out the communications fabric of a country or an adversary and they can't control their forces.
>
> 335 01:11:37.650 --&gt; 01:11:42.120 Then you can win the war. And so we must have a capability of
>
> 336 01:11:42.720 --&gt; 01:11:58.470 Maintaining communications between all of the wharf warfighting forces worldwide, and especially in a nuclear arena and I'm going to, I'm going to talk to you about the exam, some of the unique challenges we have in the in the nuclear arena.
>
> 337 01:11:59.640 --&gt; 01:12:01.350 But let's go on to the next slide please.
>
> 338 01:12:03.150 --&gt; 01:12:13.650 Michael Chase: This, this next slide, it's it's it's a build slide. So, but it's kind of Horsing Ducky, so I apologize for that. But it does help.
>
> 339 01:12:14.190 --&gt; 01:12:27.030 Michael Chase: explain a little bit what NC three is I'm just going to use an example of you know how our 911 system in our system works. So in this particular case, we're going to talk about a fire in somebody's home. Next slide please.
>
> 340 01:12:28.500 --&gt; 01:12:36.960 And there's resources to help put that fire out that are already pre positioned and these people are highly trained and they have response they have equipment.
>
> 341 01:12:37.710 --&gt; 01:12:47.700 To respond to this, but they have to know about it somehow next next build, please. So there's a there's a sequence of things, good. Go ahead and build this out. I think
>
> 342 01:12:49.050 --&gt; 01:12:50.130 Three more. Maybe
>
> 343 01:12:51.300 --&gt; 01:13:00.660 Michael Chase: So somebody can pull along arm or dial 911 and that information now goes to some kind of a command center and they're trying to determine. Well, what

> 344 01:13:00.960 --&gt; 01:13:08.550 Michael Chase: What is the nature of the emergency. Is that a fires and medical emergency. And then what kind of responses. And then they then they call the
>
> 345 01:13:09.120 --&gt; 01:13:24.750 Michael Chase: The center is in this case of fire department and and explain what the situation is the location, the extent of the emergency and then they contact the the forces that are needed to deploy to go out and and take care of those. I think it's one more, one more build, please.
>
> 346 01:13:25.890 --&gt; 01:13:38.340 So in the in the nuclear arena over on the right. These are warning us threat warning system. So we've got space based warning systems that detect nuclear detections globally.
>
> 347 01:13:38.940 --&gt; 01:13:46.170 Space based infrared early warning radar that are positioned around the country to to look for missile launches, or
>
> 348 01:13:46.740 --&gt; 01:13:54.270 Enemy activity that that the information from that has to come down to the earth. And then it has to get to the response centers and these are
>
> 349 01:13:54.540 --&gt; 01:14:08.040 Places that they've got to understand or what's the location. Is it a missile launches it as a true and how much time do we have, and it's a data correlation center this as well. Other missiles coming. Is it legitimate.
>
> 350 01:14:09.930 --&gt; 01:14:18.750 Threat. And then what is going to be our response. What do we need to do and then that information is go is goes to what we call wing command posts.
>
> 351 01:14:19.500 --&gt; 01:14:26.010 That have strategic bombers and tankers and they need to be able to contact the missile wings. The ICBM fields.
>
> 352 01:14:26.460 --&gt; 01:14:44.310 And anything that we need to do in order to respond to that to deploy and then the you know the fire engine could be those those the bombers the tankers the command centers mobile support teams that we call that go out and deploy. You can imagine that if we have incoming
>
> 353 01:14:46.260 --&gt; 01:14:54.060 Weapons and we try to predict where they're going, that we know they're going to be aiming at military targets largely and so we have to deploy.
>
> 354 01:14:55.860 --&gt; 01:15:01.920 Responsive teams that can go out and recover our aircraft and refuel and we load weapons and things like that.
>
> 355 01:15:02.190 --&gt; 01:15:14.640 That aren't at the six sites. So there's all these different different forces. So what the, what the nuclear command control is you can see in the blue there. It's the communication networks that connect all these things together.
>
> 356 01:15:15.300 --&gt; 01:15:23.640 If there's a break anywhere along that if we the warning information doesn't get to the right place and they can't reach the deployment forces and so forth, then
>
> 357 01:15:24.090 --&gt; 01:15:31.230 Then the mission can fail. So our job on the nuclear command and control communications is to make sure that no matter what happens.
>
> 358 01:15:32.190 --&gt; 01:15:39.450 That we can that the President and the senior military leadership in the theater commanders can always reach their forces.
>
> 359 01:15:40.170 --&gt; 01:15:49.650 And it has to be so assured that our adversaries knows. Absolutely. They can never take outcome, our command and control and that makes
>
> 360 01:15:50.010 --&gt; 01:16:05.430 The deterrence work and so that hopefully it's it's kind of an odd paradigm. But, but hopefully we never have to use the stuff that we're designing and building and training to use so well, obviously we exercise it. But hopefully never have to use it in real warfare.
>
> 361 01:16:06.450 --&gt; 01:16:08.070 Next, the next slide please.
>
> 362 01:16:09.390 --&gt; 01:16:09.840 So the
>
> 363 01:16:11.190 --&gt; 01:16:16.980 The three three kind of main areas that we deal with, and nuclear command and control. It's the communications part so
>
> 364 01:16:17.370 --&gt; 01:16:23.040 We're integrating I'm going to show you a picture. It's pretty big that command and control network of all these forces globally.
>
> 365 01:16:23.910 --&gt; 01:16:36.750 And so we have to integrate and manage the the sustainment of those number two is where modernizing so we're introducing new new satellite satellite communication terminals and new methods of communicating
>
> 366 01:16:38.460 --&gt; 01:16:44.490 We're adopting as some of the other engineers have mentioned some of the advanced capabilities, you know, in
>
> 367 01:16:45.000 --&gt; 01:16:55.020 Pursuing 4g and and the internet in the sky and how we integrate with all these new communication capabilities, along with the unique things that we have already
>
> 368 01:16:55.350 --&gt; 01:17:04.380 And then the third thing, and this is the one that excites me the most is we're actually, you know, through our team of engineers here and the support staff that we have
>
> 369 01:17:04.860 --&gt; 01:17:18.030 Putting together a technical vision that says, Okay, let's forget what we have now we understand the mission. Let's actually design what the communication fabric of the future should be for nuclear command and control and then
>
> 370 01:17:19.050 --&gt; 01:17:29.820 That could be we operate differently. We use technology differently, we have to be aware of new threats hypersonic weapons cyber weapons and some other things which I'm going to show you that.
>
> 371 01:17:30.930 --&gt; 01:17:44.400 We have to have technical advances, so we have to have people that can think beyond how we do things now not only technology wise but how we operate and fully understand the mission. And what we're trying to accomplish.
>
> 372 01:17:45.420 --&gt; 01:17:55.890 Michael Chase: The next slide please. This, this shows you the, what we call the Air Force NC three weapon system. There's a lot of lot of kind of a busy slide here, there's a lot of information on here.
>
> 373 01:17:56.310 --&gt; 01:18:02.460 Michael Chase: What, what I want to make clear is that you see a lot of planes. On the right, a lot of fixed ground.
>
> 374 01:18:03.030 --&gt; 01:18:09.720 Michael Chase: Things along the bottom there, but our weapon system isn't isn't for command and control isn't these aircraft themselves.
>
> 375 01:18:09.990 --&gt; 01:18:18.840 Michael Chase: It's the communication equipment that's on these aircraft that enables nuclear command and control. So at the very top VC 25 that's Air Force One
>
> 376 01:18:19.170 --&gt; 01:18:33.120 Michael Chase: So Air Force One has communication equipment on there that I'm responsible for my team is responsible for so that the President can always mean maintain contact with this forces and then there's senior Airlift Command, then you see strategic bombers.
>
> 377 01:18:34.560 --&gt; 01:18:43.110 And what we call dual capable aircraft, some of our forces in Europe that have fighters that can carry either nuclear non nuclear
>
> 378 01:18:43.470 --&gt; 01:18:53.550 Weapons down in the bottom we have all these fixed command fixed and transport, or excuse me, fixed command centers, you see the Pentagon again as I mentioned.
>
> 379 01:18:54.510 --&gt; 01:19:02.760 Our engineers in order to understand the mission to see the challenges in that I take teams of people with me and we go and visit these sites we've got
>
> 380 01:19:03.150 --&gt; 01:19:13.770 It's very cool going underneath the Pentagon and the steel room and the special places where they maintain command and control of nuclear forces in all circumstances I mentioned
>
> 381 01:19:14.160 --&gt; 01:19:19.740 GOING UNDERGROUND far over to the right and the bottom in the brown those underground lunch control centers from missiles
>
> 382 01:19:20.700 --&gt; 01:19:26.220 The third from the left on the bottom, you see CMC that's the Cheyenne Mountain complex out in the
>
> 383 01:19:26.850 --&gt; 01:19:44.580 Midwest underground almost like a little underground city it's it's incredible enter their blast blast doors, the size you can't even get your arms around, but how we can command and control from these remote underground location, some of them disclose, some of them undisclosed
>
> 384 01:19:45.630 --&gt; 01:19:51.330 Michael Chase: And then so there's all these command centers that have communication gear. So on the left.
>
> 385 01:19:51.720 --&gt; 01:20:03.690 Michael Chase: In the green. Those are the mobile teams. I'm talking to. It told you about, obviously the Space. Space external dependencies at the top, all those different capability communication satellites and then on the left those
>
> 386 01:20:04.680 --&gt; 01:20:11.160 Michael Chase: Sensors that that's a phased array early warning radar sensor really cool stuff can pick up a
>
> 387 01:20:12.150 --&gt; 01:20:21.060 Michael Chase: Contract many, many, many targets at the same time and and can detect something the size of a small like an SUV 3000 miles away.
>
> 388 01:20:21.510 --&gt; 01:20:34.170 Michael Chase: And track it. So, very cool. And we have to carry that sensor data I sell, as I said, to these command centers correlate put all the information together carry it to the decision makers and the execution forces.
>
> 389 01:20:35.220 --&gt; 01:20:54.720 As you can see 26,000 components across 110 mission dependent platforms facilities and deployment kits and pallets all over the world. So it's a pretty pretty big system and it's a again, our focus is that it's survivable that the commune command and control can always function.
>
> 390 01:20:57.330 --&gt; 01:21:09.420 Let's go to the next slide, please. Bunch of acronyms on there, we have we have really cool acronyms, but I won't try to run through them with you now. Next slide. I'm going to go over some of the unique challenges in this particular mission area.
>
> 391 01:21:11.190 --&gt; 01:21:25.650 Some of you may have heard this term, this is unclassified document that was produced by the government. A few years ago, but the challenge. One of the unique challenges that we deal with on the nuclear arena is high altitude electromagnetic pulse.
>
> 392 01:21:27.060 --&gt; 01:21:33.600 The theory is is very interesting, but any of your the double E's and maybe some of the Emmys that
>
> 393 01:21:34.320 --&gt; 01:21:47.790 Motor generator technology. Basically you pass a magnetic field across any conductor in in imposes a electric current. Well, when you have a nuclear explosion that goes off in the upper atmosphere, it actually
>
> 394 01:21:50.130 --&gt; 01:21:55.530 Michael Chase: imposes on electromagnetic waves that can that can travel many thousands of miles in
>
> 395 01:21:56.250 --&gt; 01:22:06.210 Michael Chase: It in the literally a single event of a nuclear event over the right spot in the US causes that a huge magnetic field to travel across
>
> 396 01:22:06.930 --&gt; 01:22:15.450 Michael Chase: You know, across the country and anything that to conductor will have a current imposed and those currents can be so severe that they can shut down.
>
> 397 01:22:16.290 --&gt; 01:22:22.020 Michael Chase: You know the overwhelm systems that weren't supposed to take that amount of current or that voltage build up.
>
> 398 01:22:22.440 --&gt; 01:22:39.270 Michael Chase: So you can see this report lays out and says, you can have substantial damage to the critical infrastructure oil, gas communications WATER AND SO FORTH ACROSS THE COUNTRY. So I'm going to jump to the next slide, which emphasizes the, the threat here.
>
> 399 01:22:41.010 --&gt; 01:22:51.390 The, you know, the adversary knows this. So these are unclassified quotes that are you know out there in the in the public North Korea, you know, said, hey, they could
>
> 400 01:22:52.350 --&gt; 01:23:06.450 Basically shut down our electrical grid, this is you know what they're threatening our air. Air traffic control computers and so forth. By doing EMP even, you know, Russia, many years ago and said hey we. That's the first step that we would take is
>
> 401 01:23:08.610 --&gt; 01:23:11.430 Is to, you know, shut down some of your
>
> 402 01:23:12.510 --&gt; 01:23:21.240 Infrastructure by using electromagnetic pulse in it presents an interesting policy question right a nuclear weapon that goes off, way up in the air that doesn't kill anybody.
>
> 403 01:23:21.690 --&gt; 01:23:29.280 But ends up shutting down a bunch of our electrical capability and transportation and emergency services is is pretty severe
>
> 404 01:23:29.610 --&gt; 01:23:44.550 And we need to be our, our communications network for command and control has to work even in this. So there's a lot of things that we have to do to protect our not only the nuclear forces, our military forces, but the command and control infrastructure for this.
>
> 405 01:23:45.690 --&gt; 01:23:51.390 Next slide please. So that presents a particular challenge. The next one that you see on
>
> 406 01:23:52.770 --&gt; 01:23:54.900 The next slide please, is the
>
> 407 01:23:57.540 --&gt; 01:23:58.050 Is the
>
> 408 01:24:13.800 --&gt; 01:24:14.190 Chris
>
> 409 01:24:18.840 --&gt; 01:24:22.110 Looks like we did. So it looks like we lost sound. Okay.
>
> 410 01:24:25.710 --&gt; 01:24:32.040 Well, how about that. There you go, you're backing. Thanks. Sorry about that. Yeah, I'm back one slide back on the cyber
>
> 411 01:24:33.270 --&gt; 01:24:45.600 So many of you are familiar with the cyber impacts pretty pretty awesome capability, you know, one of the problems. Obviously the cyber in this interconnected world is, you know,
>
> 412 01:24:46.080 --&gt; 01:24:58.320 We've had to kind of move move from thinking that we can protect our networks literally to assuming that the adversary is inside our networks and how do we how do we function with communication networks.
>
> 413 01:24:59.370 --&gt; 01:25:08.880 With an adversary already inside. And how do we do that it presents some substantial challenges, not just in nuclear command and control, but across the Defense Department in the country.
>
> 414 01:25:10.230 --&gt; 01:25:15.990 You can get similar effects using cyber attack that then you do with kinetic effects.
>
> 415 01:25:16.860 --&gt; 01:25:22.530 You know you can shut down grids, like I talked about before, are using cyber and the problem is attribution.
>
> 416 01:25:23.220 --&gt; 01:25:31.530 You can pretty well hide behind who actually did it. Who do you, who do you respond to. If you can't prove who actually did.
>
> 417 01:25:32.340 --&gt; 01:25:47.250 Shut down some of your network. So we've got to be able to work through these environments. Next slide please. Just quickly on this slide, you know, we have other challenges that we deal with in the communication. When we get close to theatre.
>
> 418 01:25:48.330 --&gt; 01:25:50.580 Jamming cyber attacks.
>
> 419 01:25:51.690 --&gt; 01:26:09.600 Different electronic warfare attacks. We need to be able to function in this. So we're developing waveforms that that can respond and adapt to to jamming and cyber attacks again to maintain our communication capability, even when we're close to the adversary. Next slide please.
>
> 420 01:26:10.800 --&gt; 01:26:30.570 One of the things it used to be, you know, our communication satellites that we use are generally up at geosynchronous orbit about just under 24,000 miles from here where we do our near instantaneous global communications via satellite for a number of years. We own the high ground and
>
> 421 01:26:32.100 --&gt; 01:26:42.420 That communication we've kind of gotten spoiled by using satellite communications, but that's no longer the case spaces, no longer assurant are cheap adversaries.
>
> 422 01:26:42.810 --&gt; 01:26:51.660 Now have anti-satellite weapons both kinetic and non kinetic that that threaten our capability, our satellite communications capabilities. So we better be able to operate.
>
> 423 01:26:52.620 --&gt; 01:27:02.430 And still function command and control without satellite assets that globally. And that's a, that's a big, big challenge. I will mention my son.
>
> 424 01:27:03.180 --&gt; 01:27:16.950 My son graduated mechanical engineering degree. A couple years ago with from Northeastern and he came to work for the Air Force worked with Mr fell cones organization got a great education.
>
> 425 01:27:18.870 --&gt; 01:27:25.170 Michael Chase: Working in Air Force acquisition and he was actually coming in as a GS seven
>
> 426 01:27:26.190 --&gt; 01:27:29.670 Because of their needs and because he was pretty sharp, they put him
>
> 427 01:27:30.300 --&gt; 01:27:38.250 In charge of a integrated product team he had six contractors working for them and developing some of the technology needed on one of the platforms.
>
> 428 01:27:38.670 --&gt; 01:27:46.500 That was in his portfolio. Now he's out in Colorado. The Air Force is covering the cost of his
>
> 429 01:27:47.160 --&gt; 01:27:54.510 Getting a master's in aerospace and I just spoke with him. He's, he's having a great time. He's on a summer project right now.
>
> 430 01:27:54.810 --&gt; 01:28:11.670 Where he's contacted the US space for us and said, hey, I graduate at the end of December and I really want to work. He wants to work on satellite command and control and position position navigation and timing. So they've they've sent them a model to download that actually deals with
>
> 431 01:28:13.590 --&gt; 01:28:14.640 Adversity adversarial
>
> 432 01:28:16.740 --&gt; 01:28:24.300 Attacks on on satellites and they want him to they want to show his stuff by seeing what he can do to help develop the model.
>
> 433 01:28:24.840 --&gt; 01:28:34.680 For having adversary encounters in deep space between satellite assets. And so he's having a great time doing that. And he's already got a job lined up with the Space Force.
>
> 434 01:28:35.070 --&gt; 01:28:48.750 Actually, the chief scientist Deputy Chief Scientist at the Air Force called him back and offered him a job said they would hold it for him until the end of December, he loves Colorado. So he wants to stay there. But that was a great opportunity that that he's had
>
> 435 01:28:50.790 --&gt; 01:28:53.190 You know it's close to home. Next slide.
>
> 436 01:28:54.810 --&gt; 01:28:55.080 The
>
> 437 01:28:56.490 --&gt; 01:29:10.980 Because we deal full spectrum. I call I say of DC the light, meaning you know terrestrial networks to very low frequency which is in the three to 30 kilo hertz range up to basically laser calm or the light
>
> 438 01:29:12.270 --&gt; 01:29:20.760 In the multi gigahertz in the RF realm for Satcom the nuclear effects. You can see on the right. I won't go into great detail of these because of time but
>
> 439 01:29:21.000 --&gt; 01:29:29.490 There's no magic. There's no magic solution every single communication path, whether it's line of sight are using the atmosphere for refraction or
>
> 440 01:29:29.940 --&gt; 01:29:41.970 Using Satcom has threats against it, that the adversary uses and our job is to make sure that regardless of the threat in this particular case the nuclear effects. Can't do line of sight to the
>
> 441 01:29:42.960 --&gt; 01:29:48.750 Cloud from a low altitude bursts of dust and debris, the ionosphere, which we use for refracting
>
> 442 01:29:49.140 --&gt; 01:29:55.080 radio signals gets messed up in a Nuclear environment and we still need to be able to communicate and
>
> 443 01:29:55.500 --&gt; 01:30:08.430 So we need to use all of these compacts and we need to tie them together seamlessly in a way that we can maintain that communication. And so that's that's the the message on that slide. Next slide please.
>
> 444 01:30:09.690 --&gt; 01:30:23.940 Two more of these. Now we're back to the org charts and we'll just wrap up quickly because the new weapons center organization won't spend too much time on this, other than to say I just want to show you because the final slide kind of focuses on that middle area of the gray areas.
>
> 445 01:30:26.070 --&gt; 01:30:45.120 The, the actual divisions under our Directorate. And so we've got the analysis division then see three integration division. A nuclear networks division integration embed division. And then we just added another one for strategic systems strategic communication system so
>
> 446 01:30:46.410 --&gt; 01:30:47.670 Let's jump to the next slide.
>
> 447 01:30:48.810 --&gt; 01:30:56.820 Michael Chase: Because this team comm Systems Division isn't isn't listed here because we literally just added up
>
> 448 01:30:57.600 --&gt; 01:31:06.090 Michael Chase: But of these for you see that there's there's numerous in diverse engineering opportunities as particularly as we design and build the next generation.
>
> 449 01:31:06.480 --&gt; 01:31:19.980 Michael Chase: Of NC three each at the director level each one of these divisions has their own lead engineer chief engineer. And then there's lead engineers that that cover each one of these categories, I realized, we've got some
>
> 450 01:31:21.090 --&gt; 01:31:24.510 Acronyms there, but I don't want to take more of your time on that. But
>
> 451 01:31:25.560 --&gt; 01:31:36.870 Yeah, and they're doing some really advanced stuff with architecture modeling where we're building, we're building things in models before we build them before. We've been metal or actually have to
>
> 452 01:31:37.860 --&gt; 01:31:42.240 You know, create things physically. And that's a, that's a, you know, really growing
>
> 453 01:31:42.750 --&gt; 01:32:01.890 Arena, but across the spectrum of engineering, you know, when we we have to design communication systems, but they have to go on platforms. And so there's a lot of integration than the mechanical side, computer science, the software cyber all of these things, cover the full range of engineering

> 454 01:32:03.420 --&gt; 01:32:10.800 Expertise and I think one of the great things and it's been partially mentioned before is, is your ability to cross train
>
> 455 01:32:11.340 --&gt; 01:32:19.740 In other engineering disciplines, giving you more value on your resume more value as you contribute to the mission and I think
>
> 456 01:32:20.370 --&gt; 01:32:34.680 Just having the new weapons center and the lifecycle management center both located here at Hanscom gives a cross training and career opportunities for you. You know it without having to physically move if you don't want to
>
> 457 01:32:36.150 --&gt; 01:32:36.540 So,
>
> 458 01:32:38.400 --&gt; 01:32:48.570 Anyway, I think, I think that wraps up what I wanted to try to cover and watching the time. Thank you very much for the opportunity and privilege to represent this here. Good luck to you all.
>
> 459 01:32:51.420 --&gt; 01:32:54.480 Hey, thanks Chris. This is fantastic. I really appreciate it.
>
> 460 01:32:55.530 --&gt; 01:32:59.310 I know I've been chatting with some folks online to try to answer some questions.
>
> 461 01:33:00.360 --&gt; 01:33:09.540 So more will will just take them in and get back, folks. After a real quick. I'm going to shift gears. We got about 15 minutes left right now and
>
> 462 01:33:10.500 --&gt; 01:33:23.340 We'll talk a little bit about two organizations. One is the cyber resiliency office for weapons systems. That is what I run is one of my jobs were responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force to help me.
>
> 463 01:33:24.540 --&gt; 01:33:34.950 Secure the weapon systems that are fighters you so we got a quick video we're going to tee it up. And if you can't hear the audio will actually have the closed captioning on ugly.
>
> 464 01:40:02.880 --&gt; 01:40:15.570 Michael Chase: Alright so cool video. I hope you appreciated and I we I saw that would be the weakest link posted up there. You want to take a look at it easier, but we got an awesome organization. Next slide please. So I've got about
>
> 465 01:40:17.190 --&gt; 01:40:20.100 Eight minutes to go through about 21 slide. So we're gonna go real quick. Next slide.
>
> 466 01:40:20.910 --&gt; 01:40:33.990 Back a little bit about trolls closes a brand new organization will be me. Of course, we get stood up about I want to say four years ago, we are you know everybody's talking about billion dollar budgets my budget is roughly $70 million annually.
>
> 467 01:40:35.010 --&gt; 01:40:43.110 It's not a big budget for my plan. My job is, is to increase cyber resiliency across our air force weapons systems and that's both increasing cyber hygiene.
>
> 468 01:40:43.440 --&gt; 01:40:53.520 As well as looking at unique ways such as machine learning artificial intelligence to predict attacks. It also ways to combat zero day attacks and existing systems. Next slide.
>
> 469 01:40:56.280 --&gt; 01:41:09.600 Now going to talk a little bit a lot of priorities. But essentially, we've not got priorities into both the Air Force's Space Force priorities in terms of partnerships and alliances going to hear about that a lot. I in strengthening our weapons systems next
>
> 470 01:41:11.970 --&gt; 01:41:23.490 Michael Chase: Again, our major efforts span the gamut. Right, we look at our current systems we partner with program offices, such as Michelle cone. It's Townsend disavows organizations to develop
>
> 471 01:41:23.790 --&gt; 01:41:35.220 Michael Chase: New solutions you do a lot of incubation. I look in some areas that that I'm a venture capitalist. I'm actually spending money invest a little money with a lot of small businesses to look at those new technologies.
>
> 472 01:41:35.760 --&gt; 01:41:42.090 Michael Chase: That may or may not pan out, they talk about pitch days and talk about mass challenge we're heavily invested in those as well.
>
> 473 01:41:42.480 --&gt; 01:41:52.770 Michael Chase: And again, on the right side know how do I, how do I hire people I don't hire cyber professions my challenges, I have to hire 855 cyber professionals over the next 15 years
>
> 474 01:41:53.670 --&gt; 01:42:03.030 Michael Chase: That is going to be a combination of hiring new folks like yourself to come into a cyber career I Southern question earlier about how do I cross chain from engineering into cyber
>
> 475 01:42:03.630 --&gt; 01:42:15.750 Michael Chase: We have the capabilities to help you do that. There are training programs that exist within the the career field as well as within the crows organization could be something that training. Next slide.
>
> 476 01:42:16.950 --&gt; 01:42:23.880 And I apologize if I go too fast, somebody write a thing in chat. Now, slow down a little bit, but I know your time is valuable, and I don't want to
>
> 477 01:42:24.540 --&gt; 01:42:30.780 I don't want to bore you to tears, again, is my footprint. Everybody talks about the footprint. We're building a ton of facilities, it is
>
> 478 01:42:31.500 --&gt; 01:42:39.840 mind boggling to me to find out. But folks, cannot talk about classified cyber issues to each other. So we're building a lot of cyber facilities.
>
> 479 01:42:40.620 --&gt; 01:42:51.000 My center of gravity is pulling the hits can be a Force base in the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, I've got about an 85 person organization and the majority of the people in those locations. Next slide.
>
> 480 01:42:55.260 --&gt; 01:42:55.470 Okay.
>
> 481 01:42:56.760 --&gt; 01:43:04.200 Michael Chase: No, no program would be complete if we didn't have a pathway. Right. How do I determine what am I known cyber risks, you know, look at those.
>
> 482 01:43:07.650 --&gt; 01:43:14.730 Michael Chase: That were very closely with the intelligence Lisa FBI NSA, CIA whole bunch of Defense Intelligence Agency.
>
> 483 01:43:15.210 --&gt; 01:43:20.310 Michael Chase: You seeing what of our adversaries doing what are they doing what who has the borders needs and opportunities to exploit.
>
> 484 01:43:20.640 --&gt; 01:43:28.140 Michael Chase: One of those vulnerabilities and that becomes a validated threat list and now my people working with the program offices, working with the directors of engineering
>
> 485 01:43:28.500 --&gt; 01:43:34.650 Michael Chase: will identify, is there a non material solution to combat those can I change my tactics, techniques and procedures.
>
> 486 01:43:34.980 --&gt; 01:43:46.200 Michael Chase: Or do I need to create a material solution. And if that's the case, I've got the funding the prototype of solution and then we'll prototype solution work with the director of engineering. Get that put a name here and baseline and go back and reassess. Next slide.
>
> 487 01:43:48.900 --&gt; 01:43:55.290 Again, Dr. Rope remedies mentioned, Dr. Oprah. He is kind of our change agent at the Pentagon security of course requisition
>
> 488 01:43:56.760 --&gt; 01:44:04.740 He thinks very highly others, you know, we're his cyber experts, but we aren't the ones we've got folks in the 16th year of course that help us.
>
> 489 01:44:05.460 --&gt; 01:44:15.630 As well as Glenn talks down in San Antonio Glenn's folks up in and it's going, there's, there's a lot of a lot of folks here. Let me hear a lot of teams for. Next slide.
>
> 490 01:44:17.910 --&gt; 01:44:29.370 Again, it's a team sport. We do a lot more. We do a lot with very little people very little money we created products that people use to
>
> 491 01:44:30.300 --&gt; 01:44:35.580 Disseminate intelligence information to each other, make sure that we're all grouped in because the worst thing can happen.
>
> 492 01:44:35.880 --&gt; 01:44:41.190 Is another 911 thread for one agents know about something and didn't pass that information on to another.
>
> 493 01:44:41.640 --&gt; 01:44:55.500 So we're, we're really keyed in. So that's what crows is I'm going to shift in the last three minutes. I have left talking about the Home Office, you know, the organized train, equip. How do I do my career field management. So next slide.
>
> 494 01:44:56.970 --&gt; 01:45:03.540 I'll talk a little bit on a mission where organizations I at least group and Eric Chamberlain's groups and then some of the challenges we have. Next slide.
>
> 495 01:45:04.350 --&gt; 01:45:10.920 What I've got to do is I've got to provide biggest, biggest job i think is supposed to your job as a third bullet there.
>
> 496 01:45:11.340 --&gt; 01:45:26.070 Is managed career development, training of scientists and engineers aligned to the handsome portfolio and a lot of people talk about engineering right we tend to be engineering focus, but the curriculum is more than just engineers, it is scientists, it is the entire spectrum of
>
> 497 01:45:27.210 --&gt; 01:45:39.120 Ops researchers who is a scientist Eagle scientists, you need to type of scientists, we have an obligation to help you develop yourself and Crete treat this as a career, not just a job.
>
> 498 01:45:39.600 --&gt; 01:45:44.370 We also obviously TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT we've got a lot of facilities work to do. I'm going to talk to it and then
>
> 499 01:45:45.630 --&gt; 01:45:55.110 Just making sure that we provide the technical policies and processes to the workforce in making sure that our systems are safe and operating. It's like
>
> 500 01:45:56.340 --&gt; 01:46:05.400 At least group we responsible for managing 887 position and it's an awful lot of people do a lot of education, a lot of workforce development.
>
> 501 01:46:06.330 --&gt; 01:46:20.970 Do a lot of recruiting is for civilian, especially in the acquisition community, you're going to find that under the Defense Acquisition replace acquisition. The format is actually a trauma came in, but
>
> 502 01:46:22.050 --&gt; 01:46:25.710 There are courses, we will have to take as a an acquisition
>
> 503 01:46:26.820 --&gt; 01:46:33.630 Procession in expecting to that we actually lay out a roadmap for you. The first two years to make that accomplished.
>
> 504 01:46:34.740 --&gt; 01:46:42.420 A lot of recruiting stem outreach lot of diversity management, try and make sure that our workforce represents the population at large. Next slide.
>
> 505 01:46:44.460 --&gt; 01:46:52.680 Michael Chase: So when I talked about how do I build this as a career, my guys will help you to review resume, they'll help you get ready for interviews.
>
> 506 01:46:53.670 --&gt; 01:47:03.870 Michael Chase: Hopefully, those are interviews to promotion opportunities within the the enforcer God but you know if you're going to go when you want to go to another agency will be more than happy to help you with that.
>
> 507 01:47:04.410 --&gt; 01:47:13.380 Michael Chase: Career Development we've developed the Hanscom centric as any rotation program so that you can gain experience with the new weapons center the test center about
>
> 508 01:47:14.070 --&gt; 01:47:21.000 Michael Chase: The Lifecycle Management Center without having to leave the base, which is going to be good and important to you, down the road as you develop your, your weird
>
> 509 01:47:21.570 --&gt; 01:47:36.510 Michael Chase: Also every engineer needs to show it a lot more than three years. That's your way of telling your supervisor looking reveal what is it that you want to do it helps us making poor decisions on school assignments and in other jobs and provide meaningful feedback to you.
>
> 510 01:47:38.130 --&gt; 01:47:41.100 The most important thing I will share with you guys is find a mentor.
>
> 511 01:47:42.570 --&gt; 01:47:50.640 This place is daunting, it's it's it's multi generational the worst thing that can happen is to not understand the way the the
>
> 512 01:47:51.150 --&gt; 01:48:02.520 The beast works. So I encourage you to find a mentor earn and your career. And if you don't have one. Reach out to the Caribbean to the list of folks it is dynasty and miniatures, excellent.
>
> 513 01:48:06.630 --&gt; 01:48:20.910 Again, so we've got the other division is a cyber and system engineering division we do cybersecurity engineering is, you know, we try to change the term early systems engineering. How do I make cyber resiliency in the systems, instead of trying to pull down, down.
>
> 514 01:48:22.080 --&gt; 01:48:29.550 At the end of the day, in order for our system to successfully operate in the field. They need to think road and authorization operating authorization so
>
> 515 01:48:30.060 --&gt; 01:48:47.220 How do I develop the confidence that the system is engineered from cyber perspective to be safe and secure bus. Also, I've got a really cool facilities engineering team. I've got a bunch of Civil Engineers environmental engineer structural engineers, they're constantly going
>
> 516 01:48:48.270 --&gt; 01:49:00.900 Traveling to different places throughout the world. I think I've got folks in Kwajalein right now. I've had folks, even in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, we do some really cool projects in working with our program offices. It's like
>
> 517 01:49:04.140 --&gt; 01:49:18.510 Michael Chase: Another thing we do is we've got a we've got a playground. Yeah, it's a good start to heat lab. It's basically the ability to come in and work with modeling and simulation to to kind of run some rapid innovation fund testing do some training.
>
> 518 01:49:20.700 --&gt; 01:49:25.830 Michael Chase: To kind of play with models and simulation and say, hey, this is what I did in college. I've done a lot of work modeling.
>
> 519 01:49:26.130 --&gt; 01:49:36.570 Michael Chase: How do I bring that into the, the current workforce. How do I model something and show that little changing a component in one area. What does it do for overall performance. What does it do for operational.
>
> 520 01:49:37.110 --&gt; 01:49:50.400 Michael Chase: Just evaluation. And finally, a lot of support to digital engineering, you'll hear now and it shouldn't be a surprise to you guys, but you guys grew up your digital natives, but the of course is finally going to digital engineering and digital modeling.
>
> 521 01:49:51.570 --&gt; 01:49:56.040 Michael Chase: There's a lot of work being done to the new weapons center and they were the Pathfinder and model based system engineering
>
> 522 01:49:56.460 --&gt; 01:50:10.920 Michael Chase: Working on the, the new intercontinental ballistic missile, but we're trying to embrace that technology and all the technical baseline. So I'm actually two minutes over, and I apologize for that. So that's all I have. Any questions, I know that.
>
> 523 01:50:12.060 --&gt; 01:50:19.860 Michael Chase: Wrap it up, but you can always reach me Joseph Bradley got three US today I've got mail. I'm always accessible.
>
> 524 01:50:20.790 --&gt; 01:50:27.510 Michael Chase: And I'm happy to have you. And I look forward to see you as your careers progress. Hey Sarah to add. Yeah.
>
> 525 01:50:28.140 --&gt; 01:50:34.590 Michael Chase: Go ahead and take some other questions later. Get them onto you will pass on your email address to and and the folks that support to you this morning.
>
> 526 01:50:35.520 --&gt; 01:50:42.570 Michael Chase: So we'll pass that on to them to Sir, I mean, they still have another three weeks with us. So we'll definitely get anything that they need.
>
> 527 01:50:43.080 --&gt; 01:50:51.840 Michael Chase: Have questions with will get them to you and we'll go from there. So thank you so much, sir, for your time. Now I know next time we have one of these I'm giving you three hours because
>
> 528 01:50:53.550 --&gt; 01:51:00.930 Michael Chase: You got some great information. So, and, and wow I actually, you know, I'm probably not him. Mr. Alex has been on this whole time.
>
> 529 01:51:01.380 --&gt; 01:51:09.030 Michael Chase: But this is good information. I don't even know if I career field team has all this kind of knowledge of what you're doing out there and hands come so
>
> 530 01:51:09.810 --&gt; 01:51:14.070 Michael Chase: You know, we definitely need to to make sure we share some of this, you know, one of the things I know you got to go, but
>
> 531 01:51:15.030 --&gt; 01:51:18.270 Michael Chase: One of the things we talked about I shared this with you because you're so energetic and
>
> 532 01:51:18.780 --&gt; 01:51:24.180 Michael Chase: So big into recruiting as that, you know, one of the things that I'm looking at instead of, you know, because everything is going virtual
>
> 533 01:51:24.660 --&gt; 01:51:30.690 Michael Chase: Is to get some of our piece of students to get some group of students, maybe anywhere from 15 to 20
>
> 534 01:51:31.140 --&gt; 01:51:35.430 Michael Chase: And do kind of this kind of environment as we as we do, instead of going to our actual
>
> 535 01:51:35.880 --&gt; 01:51:47.400 Michael Chase: Virtual career fairs speaking to those that are really interested in us and doing it right online, just like we are right now having the rest of us ahead of time so it's a lot of things I would like to see. Do they like to do
>
> 536 01:51:47.940 --&gt; 01:51:53.970 Michael Chase: And I will definitely keep you in the team in mind, sir, that would be great and did not. And you're exactly right. If we wrap
>
> 537 01:51:54.390 --&gt; 01:52:04.530 Michael Chase: Our newest sanctions are students that are still in college, you know in the in the folks are can relate best with what they're seeing versus what they're hearing
>
> 538 01:52:05.040 --&gt; 01:52:09.450 Michael Chase: And that experience is going to be good for us all and
>
> 539 01:52:10.410 --&gt; 01:52:24.300 Michael Chase: Yeah, I'm hope, I hope this data, this this team of steps that head back to school will get the word out. And, you know, they'll go ahead and build our next piece up on next packs to by getting the word out and getting up their resume so
>
> 540 01:52:25.770 --&gt; 01:52:31.350 Again, on behalf of myself Leda and changing the curriculum teams are always a pleasure. And thank you so much.
>
> 541 01:52:32.790 --&gt; 01:52:38.700 Thank you very much. Alright. Thanks everybody. Have a great day and enjoy the fourth and receive
>
> 542 01:52:39.990 --&gt; 01:52:41.220 The same, sir. All right.

>
> 2 00:00:07.830 --&gt; 00:00:09.300 Jayden Smith: It basically looks for the name
>
> 3 00:00:09.690 --&gt; 00:00:15.780 Jayden Smith: And you'll just Mike will put the little like whoever's talking up in the top right corner and you can click through the slides.

> 4 00:00:17.220 --&gt; 00:00:17.460 Karlyle Munz: Yeah.
>
> 5 00:00:20.370 --&gt; 00:00:20.760 That's cool.
>
> 6 00:00:21.900 --&gt; 00:00:22.470 Maddie: Um, yeah.
>
> 7 00:00:27.420 --&gt; 00:00:30.060 Maddie: Okay, well that was that's good work or
>
> 8 00:00:32.940 --&gt; 00:00:33.720 Maddie: Anything else
>
> 9 00:00:37.980 --&gt; 00:00:40.440 Maddie: You're being other questions that I can help with
>
> 10 00:00:44.280 --&gt; 00:00:45.630 Maddie: Madison, if you
>
> 11 00:00:47.310 --&gt; 00:00:52.590 Maddie: If you can't get ahold of Miss Davis or missing that or whatever I can find you a career field.
>
> 12 00:00:54.900 --&gt; 00:01:04.380 Maddie: Contact. Also, honestly, I might be able to find everybody's so like you'll have government emails, but in the government, you know, you can like search like global
>
> 13 00:01:05.520 --&gt; 00:01:06.900 Maddie: Search everybody's
>
> 14 00:01:09.450 --&gt; 00:01:11.670 Maddie: Like I can find anybody's email ever
>
> 15 00:01:12.270 --&gt; 00:01:12.780 Maddie: I just
>
> 16 00:01:12.870 --&gt; 00:01:15.000 Maddie: I would have to know I would have to find somebody
>
> 17 00:01:16.620 --&gt; 00:01:28.050 Maddie: That works under them like our works with them and I could click and see who they all work for an academic find it so I could do some serious digging. If you need me to and find find you on if your supervisor can help.
>
> 18 00:01:28.560 --&gt; 00:01:29.160 Maddie: Just like I think
>
> 19 00:01:29.670 --&gt; 00:01:42.120 Geneva Anderson: I think at this point since we've basically finished the match com everyone just needs to do is just email your supervisor and just say, Hey, this is what we need to do. Can you give us information, and if not, can you point us towards our career field.
>
> 20 00:01:43.140 --&gt; 00:01:48.270 Geneva Anderson: Because at this point it's literally we just all need to do a slide basically and we're done. Yeah.
>
> 21 00:01:48.420 --&gt; 00:01:48.930 Correct.
>
> 22 00:01:50.040 --&gt; 00:02:03.030 Maddie: So, and you can add like pictures and things I'm to your slides. They just have to be within the white square of the PC format, but you can like make it look better.
>
> 23 00:02:03.840 --&gt; 00:02:04.710 Rachelle H.: Now better just like
>

>
> 51 00:03:50.130 --&gt; 00:04:01.020 Maddie: Designated know deliberately designate the organization. So we've had. So we had like it wasn't like match com related. It was just like they gave us this thing and we actually talked about. So do is like a
>
> 52 00:04:04.710 --&gt; 00:04:09.450 Maddie: Like what a, I don't know. It's like a technique that people could use in their company to like
>
> 53 00:04:10.530 --&gt; 00:04:17.910 Maddie: Promote certain things. So like, look, we had like little like I'm saying, like, like, like pictures and stuff and
>
> 54 00:04:18.480 --&gt; 00:04:23.190 Maddie: So we have an agenda beginning to talk about like all the things we're talking about. So y'all might want to add that, too. So like
>
> 55 00:04:23.640 --&gt; 00:04:29.820 Maddie: Just literally just like as an agenda and have bullet points and you're, you're just somebody who starts up whoever introduces will just say
>
> 56 00:04:30.360 --&gt; 00:04:36.990 Maddie: Hey, I'm Mary Oliver and today we're going to be talking about what did you do, is how companies are currently using this method.
>
> 57 00:04:37.680 --&gt; 00:04:55.830 Maddie: How it how it could benefit FPC what the implementation look like and what kind of methodology will be working with the funding and how long it will take just, you know, and so I would have something at the beginning like that. Did you also have this at the bottom, the Agile hahaha
>
> 58 00:04:58.200 --&gt; 00:04:58.620 Andrew Swisher: Yes.
>
> 59 00:04:58.800 --&gt; 00:05:03.720 Maddie: I remember saying that it was there. It's there. Yep. Okay, great. Oh, man.
>
> 60 00:05:05.370 --&gt; 00:05:18.570 Maddie: We've been I just talked about all those things on my agenda. So what to do. So look, it can be different than like you can like see how like there's not bullet points like you know I'm saying you can just like you can make it whatever it just has to be in specific fonts and
>
> 61 00:05:19.680 --&gt; 00:05:20.970 Maddie: Like sizes, a font.
>
> 62 00:05:22.110 --&gt; 00:05:25.620 Maddie: But you can pretty much do what you want in this portion of it.
>
> 63 00:05:26.820 --&gt; 00:05:31.560 Maddie: Okay, so he's talking about like what it is we had this quote
>
> 64 00:05:33.630 --&gt; 00:05:41.460 Maddie: And we had to use like resources like we have used books and stuff. So we had to come up with like ways to like integrate the book into our vision.
>
> 65 00:05:43.170 --&gt; 00:05:43.860 Maddie: Different companies.
>
> 66 00:05:45.630 --&gt; 00:05:48.300 Maddie: And then different companies. We had to talk about like
>
> 67 00:05:51.330 --&gt; 00:06:04.470 Maddie: We have to bring other like examples. And so I would definitely try to make your things minimum minimal and then just talk about. So there was a whole speech. Somebody gave on next jump and Bridgewater, but we didn't type it all out. Right.
>
> 68 00:06:07.410 --&gt; 00:06:22.200 Maddie: And then this was a long on this was a year ago and they remember. Oh, this is the next jump company just like talking about that Bridgewater dreamin it. So, look, we added like pictures like this was their logo and the logo. So maybe you can find some in it. So they have RC and put it
>
> 69 00:06:24.120 --&gt; 00:06:30.420 Maddie: Maybe could find something that says like for support contracting. I think they all have little logos, maybe, and
>
> 70 00:06:32.340 --&gt; 00:06:33.330 Maddie: How to implement
>
> 71 00:06:33.570 --&gt; 00:06:33.960 Andrew Swisher: Whatever.
>
> 72 00:06:34.710 --&gt; 00:06:35.880 Maddie: So it's not that exciting but
>
> 73 00:06:38.610 --&gt; 00:06:39.180 Maddie: Our timeline.
>
> 74 00:06:39.540 --&gt; 00:06:47.070 Maddie: And then we had our timeline. So we like. So you can. You don't even have to use words you can use like charts. I don't know if y'all need a chart for anything but maybe
>
> 75 00:06:47.880 --&gt; 00:06:55.890 Maddie: Maybe you could put like a little like maybe you could put words and then underneath. Just a simple Timeline of, like, so like for support. Like, I went home. On March 16
>
> 76 00:06:56.250 --&gt; 00:07:11.400 Maddie: And then on this once a month, we have a meeting with our director and then we were supposed to go back to this day, but it didn't happen. So now indefinitely. We're here at home, you know, something like that.
>
> 77 00:07:13.980 --&gt; 00:07:15.000 Michael Chase: I'm great at making those
>
> 78 00:07:15.240 --&gt; 00:07:16.470 Maddie: Smile. Perfect.
>
> 79 00:07:17.490 --&gt; 00:07:18.600 Maddie: Hello, hello smiley face.
>
> 80 00:07:21.840 --&gt; 00:07:27.930 Maddie: Also, we had a limit on flights and time. I think you're only have a time limit, you have a slide limit to
>
> 81 00:07:30.150 --&gt; 00:07:30.390 Andrew Swisher: Know,
>
> 82 00:07:30.570 --&gt; 00:07:32.130 Maddie: So that's kind of why I always have a lot of words.
>
> 83 00:07:33.360 --&gt; 00:07:41.430 Maddie: Like I wouldn't put this many words but like we had that we only had like 15 slides or something. We couldn't go over. So it was like trying to cram it all, but
>
> 84 00:07:42.150 --&gt; 00:07:54.720 Maddie: Until you see I use like different bullet points. It doesn't have to be specific. It can be anything. It's really just like this top part has to be the same and the bottom part and then your font has to be like specific but besides that. It can be anything.
>
> 85 00:07:56.340 --&gt; 00:07:57.060 Maddie: Else math.
>
> 86 00:07:59.700 --&gt; 00:08:04.500 Maddie: Yeah, and then a DP map. And it's very complicated or
>
> 87 00:08:06.180 --&gt; 00:08:11.730 Maddie: And then, oh, this was current benefits in time. So instead of career fields we did sections. So like
>
> 88 00:08:12.810 --&gt; 00:08:14.970 Maddie: What was this one. I know this. So,
>
> 89 00:08:17.130 --&gt; 00:08:34.860 Maddie: In for support. Sorry if I were to just for support people also like my group was all just for sport. So within for sport you can work in staffing classification or benefits and entitlements. And so we did like that versus doing the career fill as a whole.
>
> 90 00:08:36.780 --&gt; 00:08:40.830 Oh, I don't know what the timeline is. Oh, oh, it's coming. It's coming.
>
> 91 00:08:45.870 --&gt; 00:08:52.800 Maddie: Oh, and then I told you all at the beginning I had like a vision. We have a physical vision board that we made. So that was we talked about it right here.
>
> 92 00:08:54.360 --&gt; 00:08:59.970 Maddie: And then I was it and then you have to end with this. I don't know if that was in your ending, but you have to end with a emblem.
>
> 93 00:09:01.500 --&gt; 00:09:02.730 Maddie: And and then References
>
> 94 00:09:04.170 --&gt; 00:09:06.420 Maddie: And that's it. So, um,
>
> 95 00:09:07.500 --&gt; 00:09:11.310 Maddie: Yeah, ours. Ours was 19 slides. So I guess I think 20 was are like
>
> 96 00:09:12.540 --&gt; 00:09:13.500 Maddie: Minimum or whatever.
>
> 97 00:09:14.550 --&gt; 00:09:16.110 Maddie: On my tabs. This is my life.
>
> 98 00:09:18.180 --&gt; 00:09:19.560 Maddie: And so
>
> 99 00:09:20.850 --&gt; 00:09:24.360 Maddie: Yeah, that's, that's all I got for you. That was my project.
>
> 100 00:09:27.480 --&gt; 00:09:27.660 Yeah.
>
> 101 00:09:31.170 --&gt; 00:09:34.560 Maddie: So y'all need to do before besides critical stuff.
>
> 102 00:09:36.210 --&gt; 00:09:38.340 Karlyle Munz: That's it. Right. We know how it works.
>
> 103 00:09:38.400 --&gt; 00:09:41.160 Karlyle Munz: We can actually work on the slides a little more
>
> 104 00:09:41.520 --&gt; 00:09:42.390 Maddie: The curve. Yeah.
>
> 105 00:09:42.450 --&gt; 00:09:43.560 Karlyle Munz: Yeah, that makes a lot easier.
>
> 106 00:09:44.040 --&gt; 00:09:49.950 Maddie: Yeah, so I'm just work on. I mean, I would just get the information for the you're pretty much ahead, you're fine.
>
> 107 00:09:50.700 --&gt; 00:10:00.660 Maddie: So just get the curricula information and that now that your head if they don't reply immediately. It'll be fine. You know, you have to literally the 20th or something to get it. So you have 20
>
> 108 00:10:00.660 --&gt; 00:10:03.390 Maddie: Days. Um, so
>
> 109 00:10:04.560 --&gt; 00:10:05.550 Maddie: Yeah, I would just
>
> 110 00:10:07.080 --&gt; 00:10:13.200 Maddie: Contact critical people and see if they can help and or your supervisor and then if they can't help contact the
>
> 111 00:10:14.610 --&gt; 00:10:15.570 Maddie: Field team.

>
> 113 00:10:18.630 --&gt; 00:10:21.630 Maddie: And then the 20th, or whenever before then.
>
> 114 00:10:21.810 --&gt; 00:10:33.780 Maddie: Because obviously my days are off, we can meet again and then just we can put your presentation together and then y'all can like practice and y'all can figure out how to record it on zoom or whatever.
>
> 115 00:10:35.520 --&gt; 00:10:39.930 Maddie: And then you'll be good to go. So y'all aren't going to present at the
