## Legacy Meeting Interlude

* Jacob will be 17: his birthday is tomorrow.
* We're having trouble getting them to work with each other. 

## Teamwork Facilitated Mentor

* **Go to meetings 15 minutes early.**

### The Importance of Diversity

* We have **different communication styles**: some are good with email and others are poor.

### Dealing with Bad Ideas

* Talk about it with a person in private.
* Here are some issues?
  * Ask: how are you going to deal with them?

### Impossible Requirements

Someone is going to demand something that is impossible to create. You want to shoot lasers and weight the weight of a paper clip.

* Acknowledge what they want:
* State the facts
  * Laser technology is not developed yet.
  * Throw money at it.
  * I can do that for $5bn; some people only respond to money.
* Get someone who is more experienced:
  * Ask them how to talk to this difficult person.
* Ask for help
  * How can I get to that point?
  * What would you like me to do instead?
* The Trifecta of program managers. 
  * Cost
  * Schedule
  * Performance
  * You can't have all three.

### Improving Performance Within a Team

* **Lessons Learned**
  * Reach out to people who have already solved the project.
* **Games**
  * Have some sort-of race.
* **Self Analysis**
* **Ask for Feedback**
  * Random, unsolicited.
  * You don't know if you don't ask.
* **Goals, Expectations, and Deadlines**
  * Establish them.
  * Clear expectations and clear metrics.

### Bad Teams

### Incomplete Information

* Everyone has to know the important information.
* Not one person knowing everything and trying to coordinate it all.

* You can hide behind it.
* You can refuse to use it and get nothing done.

### Creativity

* Rapid prototyping

### Make Friends

* Make friends where you are
* Be respectful of everyone, and try to become friends with a few people you work with.
* It makes your life so much easier.
