# \*Day 007: New Employee Orientation

## Legacy

* Friday, 12:00PM.
  * Eat lunch, turn your webcams on?

## Homework

* I took most of the day off.
* I only logged 2hrs of work so far I think, for legacy meetings at the GRILL and some PCIP program stuff. I'll make the rest up later; I know what I need to be working on.

## Ted Talk Tuesday

We have these Ted Talks every Tuesday where we watch a Ted Talk and talk about it with the group. That's what I'm currently working on right now.

### Nigerian Story-Reading

* She's black and read a British Book.
* White people talked about the weather, ate apples in those books.
* Because all of her books \(donated, not African\), she understood only British literature about white people.
* She didn't know that black people could exist in literature because she never read it before.

## Core Values

1. Integrity First

3. Excellence in All We Do

Why? It builds trust.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

See [this](https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/Volume_2/V2-D05-Core-Values.pdf) document and [this](https://www.airman.af.mil/HeritageToday/videoid/423997/dvpcc/false/#DVIDSVideoPlayer33885) video!

{% hint style="info" %}
See this [link](https://www.airman.af.mil/HeritageToday/videoid/424000/dvpcc/false/#DVIDSVideoPlayer33885) for some pretty cool videos and posters!
{% endhint %}

### Integrity First

Our first core value, Integrity, is an important trait. It is a willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. It is a moral compass, the voice of self-control; the basis for the trust imperative in today's military. Integrity is the single most important part of character. It is the ability to hold together and properly regulate all of the elements of a personality. A person of integrity, is capable of acting on conviction. It encompasses the following: Courage, Honesty, Responsibility, Accountability, Justice, Openness, Self-Respect, and Humility.

### Service Before Self

As a good person, mentor and leader, it helps to put other's needs before your own. Service before self is both a military and a personal moral obligation. An example of “Service Before Self” is Airman first class \(A1C\) John Levitow.

### Excellence in All We Do

Now let's discuss excellence in all we do. This core value demands that Airmen constantly strive to perform at their best. It is a commitment to high standards and understanding that each Airman has been entrusted with our nation's security. This core value challenges us to establish a culture of excellence and an environment where teamwork, communication, creativity, mutual respect and commitment to outstanding service exists. This culture also extends into personal excellence to be physically and mentally ready, meaning that we must maintain fitness and continually seek to develop ourselves educationally.

{% hint style="success" %}
I love these values; these are wonderful.
{% endhint %}

## Airman

> The men and women of the United States Air Force are called Airmen. The term Airman includes: active duty military, members of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, **and Air Force civilian employees**.  The success of the Air Force mission depends on all Airmen working together, so it is important that every civilian employee have an understanding about civilian contributions,  and part of the history and mission of the US Air Force.
>
> Every Airman contributes to the mission!

### Civilians are Airmen

> * Civilian employees have been around since the beginning of air power
> * They have played critical roles in intelligence, weapons development, supply, education, and many support functions
> * Civilian Airmen provide “specialized continuity"

{% hint style="info" %}
"Aim high airmen." \(I love it\)
{% endhint %}

## Oath of Office

> **“I, \(**_**state your full name**_**\), do solemnly swear \(**_**or affirm**_**\) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well; and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God \(optional\).”**

## Air Force Customs

Air Force customs are practices normally established by usage over a long period of time.  Many of these have evolved as military tradition.  Customs can apply on, and off, military installations and include saluting, precedence, and, ceremonies.

For detailed guidance [AFI 34-1201 \(Links to an external site.\)](https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi34-1201/afi34-1201.pdf), Protocol establishes policy and provides additional guidance for excellence in protocol, decorum, customs and courtesies during Air Force ceremonies, conferences and social events. 

## Saluting

Saluting is one of the courtesies associated with the military. It is a uniform military custom dating back many centuries. Only uniformed military members render a salute - civilians do not. Saluting is initiated by the junior member and returned by the senior member. Saluting is rendered to the US flag. It is not done indoors unless prescribed by nature of the ceremony.

## Ceremony

```text
O! say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming:
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming,
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;

O! say, does that Star-spangled Banner still* wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam --
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;

'Tis the Star-spangled Banner, O! long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave.
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave!

And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O! thus be it ever when free men shall stand
Between their loved homes and the foe's desolation;
Bless'd with victory and peace, may our Heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just --
And this be our motto -- "In God is our trust!"

And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
```

```text
Off we go into the wild blue yonder,

Climbing high into the sun;

Here they come zooming to meet our thunder, 

At 'em, boys, Give 'er the gun! (Give 'er the gun now!) 

Down we dive, spouting our flame from under,

Off with one helluva roar! 

We live in fame or go down in flame. Hey! 

Nothing will stop the U.S. Air Force!

Minds of men fashioned a crate of thunder, 

Sent it high into the blue;

Hands of men blasted the world asunder;

How they lived God only knew! (God only knew then!)

Souls of men dreaming of skies to conquer 

Gave us wings, ever to soar! 

With scouts before And bombers galore. Hey! 

Nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force!
```

## Precedence

> Precedence is a recognized system of international courtesy. It is the starting point for almost everything done in protocol from organizing the order of arrival and departure to seeing to introductions of distinguished guests. Failure to give proper recognition to the rank of a government official can be the equivalent of insulting the official position and the country he or she represents. In fact, wars have started because of failure to give proper recognition. 
>
> **Order of Precedence**
>
> The United States [Order Of Precedence \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Order-of-Precedence.pdf) is an advisory document maintained by the Ceremonials Division. For purposes of protocol, the U.S. Order of Precedence establishes the order and ranking of U.S. leadership for official events at home and abroad. Although this document establishes a general order for the country’s highest-level positions, it does not include every positional title across the federal government. Offices of Protocol for the Executive Departments and independent agencies should be consulted for internal rankings regarding positions not listed.

## Courtesies

> Now that you have a basic knowledge of some of the Air Force's customs, we will now learn about courtesies. Courtesies are marks of respect paid to persons or symbols and are common throughout society. Courtesies apply on and off military installations and include flag etiquette, civility, communication and professional behavior.

### Flag Etiquette

> Because the flag represents the ideals, values and best aspirations of our country, giving fitting respect to the flag demonstrates our appreciation of a commitment to those same values.  Groups may recite the pledge to the flag when attending Air Force functions and social or public events. 
>
> Click[ here \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title4/html/USCODE-2011-title4-chap1.htm) to view 4 USC, Title 4, Flag and  Seal, Seat of Government, and the States, Chapter 1 - the Flag.

### Displaying the Flag

> There are certain protocols regarding the positioning of the U.S. flag in relationship to other flags and in particular situations.
>
> ![US Flag iwth Another Flag.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255720/preview)**Flags at Ceremonies**
>
> If the American flag is carried with only one other flag, the color bearer should march in line, but not to the right of the other flag.
>
> ![US Flag Vertical.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255681/preview)**Horizontally or Vertically on a Wall or a Window**
>
> Always display the flag with the union at the top to the observer's left.
>
> ![US Flag Auditorium.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255743/preview)**Auditorium**
>
> In church or public auditorium, the U.S. Flag is in place of honor to the speaker's right. Always display the flag with the union to the oberver's left. The flag holds the position of prominence in front of the audience.

### Respect The Flag

> The  flag is NOT to be:
>
> * Dipped to any person or thing
> * Used as a furniture covering or as wearing apparel
> * Draped over any part of a vehicle, railroad train, boat, or airplane
> * Displayed, fastened, used, or stored in any manner that it can be easily torn, soiled, or damaged
> * Used as a receptacle for receiving or carrying objects
> * Used for advertising purposes
> * Marked with insignias, letters, words, emblems, figures, or designs

### [Reveille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD1aTKzksmk) and Retreat

> Reveille is the signal for the start off the official duty day, and to honor the U.S. flag as it is raised in the morning. Because the time for the start of the duty day varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for reveille.
>
> The sounding of retreat is done at the end of the duty day and also indicates the national anthem is about to play. During the playing of reveille and retreat, civilians stand at attention with their right hand over their heart. If you are driving on a military installation, pull over and stop your car.  Due to safety concerns with traffic, pulling over and stopping your car may vary at some installations.

### Civility

> Rules of civility have been around in one form or another since the dawn of civilization. Through civility, we establish expectations for treating others fairly, respectfully and considerately. Civility goes beyond basic politeness. It includes how we pay attention to the needs of others and how we demonstrate appropriate respect. It governs our regard for the rights and ideas of others.

### Introductions

> There are certain courtesies you should always use when introducing yourself.  Take the initiative to introduce yourself.  Don't interrupt.  Wait for the opportune moment. **Use the other person's title, such as Doctor, Misses, Mister, Chaplain, or, Major. However, never give yourself a title. Lastly,  always stand when introducing yourself.**  
>
> When introducing others, **introductions are based on power and precedence.** Gender does not affect the order of introductions. Who is introduced first is determined by precedence. The person who holds the highest position in an organization takes precedence over others. The name of the person of greater authority is always spoken first, no matter the gender.

### Offices

> Here is a brief list of other common office courtesies you will find helpful: 
>
> * Do not lean or sit on someone else's desk 
> * Do not lean back and put your feet on your desk or anyone else's desk 
> * Avoid needless, loud joke telling and chatter in hallways or in open work environments 
> * **Unless told otherwise, rise and stand when a senior officer or Senior Executive Service member enters or departs a room** 
> * If a room is called to attention because of a senior leader entering the room, military and civilian personnel should stand

### Telephone & Writing Etiquette

> Here are some guidelines for telephone etiquette:
>
> * AF is a customer service organization
> * You provide the caller’s first impression of the Air Force
> * Good phone skills are a must
> * Need to have an attitude of service
> * Must keep conversation professional
> * Telephone callers gain 15% of what you say and 85% from your tone
>
> If your Air Force organization permits the use of a cell phone in your workplace setting, the first rule is:  Use the same business protocol for your cell phone that you would use for your office phone.
>
> AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, Chapter 12 provides additional guidance on Telephones, voice mail and FAX.

{% endhint %}

### Social Media

> Social media for Airmen:
>
> * Consider how a post can be interpreted by the public
> * Be cautious about crossing the line between funny and distasteful
> * If you have doubts about whether you should post something, err on the side of caution
> * If the post in question concerns the AF,  refer to Chapter 5 of AFI 35-107, discuss the proposed post with your supervisor or your local public affairs office.  Do not post if the content is questionable.
> * Maintain appropriate communication and conduct with everyone
> * When posting on social media platforms you can use hashtags to help tell your story to a wider audience

### Professional Appearance

> Now that we have discussed communication, we'll review a form of non-verbal communication: your personal appearance. The image you present through your personal appearance can have as much of an impact as other customs and courtesies you follow. As an Airman, you are a representative of the Air Force, and your clothing and grooming should reflect this. For civilians, business attire is defined by society's standards. This next section will help you to know these standards, allowing you to project the image you want to achieve.
>
> Appropriate dress standards may vary based on work function and location.  A good standard to remember is that attire should not be disruptive, unsafe, or offensive to others who must work with you. The appropriate civilian dress should correspond to military uniform and can be broken into two categories: business attire and business casual. Business attire is the standard of dress for your business environment,  whereas business casual is a "slight" relaxation of some aspects of the standard attire.

## Wingman Concept

{% hint style="success" %}
This is an important one to take outside of the Air Force with me, wherever I go.
{% endhint %}

> Every Airman, whether military or civilian, is a precious resource that we absolutely must have in order to accomplish our mission. When we lose a fellow Airman as a result of a mishap, accident or suicide, there are far reaching impacts to the mission, team members, unit, the individual's family and our Air Force family. That is why we have the Wingman Program. One of the program's objectives is for Airmen to get to know their fellow Airmen well enough to know if they are exhibiting risk factor behaviors, and to have knowledge and skills to assist them with getting help. 
>
> Click [here  \(Links to an external site.\)](http://www.wingmanonline.org/Home)to visit U.S. Air Force Wingman Online

### Be a Good Wingman

You may ask yourself "How can I be a wingman?" For starters, use the BASIC Peer Support Checklist. Start by being there. Have an awareness of needs. Perform shared planning and implementation of the plan and continue support. 

![](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255837/preview)

### Wingman Practice

> A wingman provides emotional and intellectual support to fellow Airmen in many ways. Here are some characteristics of a good wingman:
>
> * Show concern and actively listen
> * Don't let their fellow Airmen participate in self-destructive behavior
> * Intervene when appropriate
> * Maximize personal and team safety on and off the job
> * Develop true caring relationships with co-workers
> * Be aware of assistance programs available

### The Evolution of the Wingman

> The wingman concept applies to all areas within the Air Force workforce, but primarily, the following items are why the wingman concept has evolved:
>
> * Suicide prevention
> * Mishap reduction
> * Reintegration after returning from deployment
> * High-risk off-duty activities
> * Protecting our Wingmen from sexual assault
> * Risk associated with drinking and drugs
>
> We need to help our fellow Airmen see threats they didn't realize and prevent them from occurring.

## Suicide Prevention

> One of the biggest challenges we face today is reducing the number of suicides that occur. Studies have proven that an estimated 90% of suicides are preventable provided help is available. That is why the Air Force has created the Air Force Suicide Prevention Program. This program emphasizes where to get help, how to apply the Wingman Concept in these situations, and provides Airmen with information on warning signs of suicide.
>
> Remember, the loss of one Airman's life is one too many, so suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility.  An Employee Assistance Program \(EAP\) is a voluntary confidential program that helps employees \(including management\) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success. EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees.

## Workforce Health

Now that we have covered the Wingman Concept, let's move on to workforce health. In this section we will cover physical fitness, diet, and nutrition.

![Workforce health 2.PNG](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255885/preview) Click [here \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/worklife/health-wellness/) to view OPM Work-Life Health and Wellness

### Physical Fitness Benefits

> There are many benefits from leading a healthy lifestyle including fewer health problems and simply feeling better. Some benefits to the Air Force also include increased productivity, optimized health of workforce, and decreased absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of readiness.
>

Participation is strictly voluntary.  Please check with your supervisor and/or CPS for local base participation guidance.

{% endhint %}

### Aerobic Exercise

> The first portion of an effective fitness program supporting a healthy lifestyle is aerobic conditioning. It increases the number of blood cells so your blood can carry more oxygen. It helps blood travel more efficiently through you blood vessels and strengthens your heart's ability to contract. This stronger, more efficient blood flow makes the body better equipped for exercise and is essential for weight loss, cardiovascular fitness and body shaping. Some examples of aerobic exercise include running, swimming, biking and dancing.

### Strength Training

> Strength training is the second major part of this fitness program. It focuses on building strength and lean mass in the body's muscles. Research shows that we lose muscle mass throughout our lives. In fact, between 25 and 75 years of age, some people lose as much as 30% of muscle mass. Strength training helps to reduce that loss. While you work to strengthen your muscles, working on their flexibility is the other key to creating lean muscle mass. Stretching and doing full range of motion on any strength exercises are vital in developing flexibility for lean muscle.

### Healthy Eating

> The last portion of an effective fitness program involves a healthy diet. Eating the right foods, in the right amounts, makes all the difference in attaining your fitness goals. In addition, taking that right mix and developing a sustainable habit of healthy eating takes time, and sometimes professional help. There are educational programs and information available from a variety of sources. See your physician and/or the base Health and Wellness Center for additional information on healthy eating.

## Workplace Safety

Everyone has a role in workforce safety. This is why OSHA developed a Voluntary Protection Program \(VPP\) to recognize and promote effective worksite based safety and health management systems. The Air Force promotes this program, making it a goal that safety and health become integrated with our processes, procedures and thinking. The VPP has four parts, all working together to make it operate effectively. Please take a moment to review the diagram regarding the VPP.

![](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255878/preview)

### Mishap Reduction - Hazards

Preventing mishaps from occurring in the first place is the easiest way to reduce mishaps. There are three elements associated with mishap prevention: identification, tracking and correction. Identifying mishaps or potential mishaps is a crucial area of workforce safety. As an individual, you should pay careful attention to your surroundings and identify any potential areas of risk within your work environment. In the event of identifying a mishap, supervisors are your first point of contact. Supervisors and the base safety office are responsible for tracking all hazards to ensure corrective action is taken. The goal is to prevent recurrence. Your cooperation in mishap reporting allows these staff members to conduct proper investigations, track the number of occurrences for possible trends, and correct the problems to prevent recurrence. Mishaps and hazards are corrected through interim controls and permanent corrective actions. While supervisors and safety personnel are primarily responsible for these actions, it is important that everyone is aware of the steps taken to ensure each employee is working in the safest possible environment.

![](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255893/preview)

### Office Hazards

1 - **Chemical spill**. Chemicals can be extremely dangerous. Do not attempt to handle these on your own. Dial 911 immediately.

2 - **Blocked walkway**.  All walkways should be free of clutter. Dispose of paper in the recycling bin or by shredding it \(based on security considerations\).

3 - **Faulty or unattended appliances**. Engineering the appliance to add a safety turn-off switch can prevent fires when appliances fail or are left on. 

4 - **Non-hazardous spills**. Spills happen and should be mopped up immediately. If it is not your spill, clean it up anyway. This will eliminate a potential hazard.

### Injury Compensation 

> In the event you do suffer a workforce mishap/injury there are specific steps/requirements that must be followed:
>
> Talk with your supervisor to make them aware prior to starting the procedure.
>

### Off-Duty Safety

> We've discussed safety issues found in the work environment, now it's time to focus on off-duty safety. Why are we concerned about off-duty safety? Each member of our Air Force workforce is important to us, and we do not want to lose anyone if it can be prevented. Did you know that statistically, off-duty vehicle mishaps and drowning are the leading causes of death for military personnel? That is why off-duty safety is so important. Through training, education and everyone's involvement, we can prevent off-duty mishaps from occurring. Some of the off-duty safety concerns we will go over are driving while distracted, motorcycle safety, safety belts and alcohol use.

This is obvious... moving on...

### Motorcycles

> Anyone who drives a motorized two-wheel vehicle on an Air Force installation must receive the appropriate motorized safety training. Riders should contact the base safety office regarding information on their installation’s policy for training. Most bases have their own training certification courses, however, if they do not you will be referred to a local organization who conducts the training.

### Summary

> We have just covered information on various areas of safety. Some of the key topics addressed are vital to being safe on and off duty. This information should provide you a foundation of thinking about safety for you and your wingman no matter where you are. To learn more about Air Force safety programs and training, visit the Air Force safety portal website. Click [here \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.safety.af.mil//) to view the website.

## Workforce Security

> We will now focus on another important wingman concept: workforce security. This concept encompasses:
>
> * Personnel security
> * Information Security
> * Operations Security \(OPSEC\)
> * Force Protection Condition \(FPCON\)
> * Information Operations Condition \(INFOCON\)
>
> The Air Force's workforce security management makes sure members meet the national and local standards required to accomplish the mission.

### Personnel Security



Personnel security is a set of administrative procedures that serves to ensure acceptance and retention of personnel in the armed forces and DoD. It's important to know the security clearance process and your responsibilities if you have clearance eligibility. Read the topics below for more information.

![Investigation.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255831/preview)**Investigation**

* Investigations are conducted for three main reasons 
  * HSPD-12 \(credentialing/access to facilities and systems\)
  * Suitability/Fitness \(for employment\)
  * National Security \(for security clearance eligibility\)

![Adjudication.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255850/preview)**Adjudication**

* Security Clearance Eligibility
  * A determination that a person is eligible for access to classified information and/or to occupy a national security sensitive position
  * Determination is made through adjudication of reliable information from the investigation and variables known as the "whole person concept" using the 13 Adjudicative Guidelines
* DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility \(DoD CAF\) is the authority for making security clearance eligibility determinations
* Contact your Information Protection Office if you have questions about your clearance eligibility

![reinvestigation.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255892/preview)**Periodic Re-investigation**

Do you have clearance eligibility? Know you reporting requirements!

* Individuals must report certain information and life events that occur after being granted clearance eligibility
  * Report info that falls under the 13 Adjudicative Guidelines \(see next slide\)
  * Rport to the DoD CAF via the Information Protection Office
  * Applies to all with clearance eligibility, not just access to classified
* Don't be afraid to report!
  * Reporting information does not automatically revoke clearance eligibillity
  * The DoD CAF will make the determination based on the whole person concept and will consider mitigating factors
  * Reporting may help you learn about available resources that offer assistance

![selfreporting.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255886/preview)**Self-Reporting**

What's reportable?

* Changes to:
  * Name
  * Marital status, co-habitation, or addition of family member
  * Citizenship
* Certain events and information
  * Criminal activity \(arrests, issuance of restraining order, etc.\)
  * DUI/DWI
  * Alcohol or drug related incident or addiction diagnosis
  * Financial difficulties, excessive indebtedness, collection accounts, bankruptcy
  * Use of illegal drugs
  * Foreign contacts \(close or continuing association with foreign nationals\)
  * Foreign travel
  * Potential espionage indicators

### Information Security

> Information security is a system of policies, procedures and requirements established by the Air Force to protect classified and controlled unclassified information that if subjected to unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to National Security.
>
> **Classified Information**
>
> ![Classified.PNG](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255896/preview)Classified information has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and it must be marked to indicate its level of classification. You’ll be notified if you required access to classified information and will receive additional training on areas like marking a document, safeguarding information, and security incidents. For access to classified information, the following conditions must be met:
>
> * Clearance eligibility
> * Signed non-disclosure agreement
> * Need-to-know
>
> **Controlled Unclassified Information \(CUI\)**
>
> ![CUI\_.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255846/preview)Controlled unclassified information or CUI is unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant and consistent with applicable law, regulation and government wide policy. The following documents that fall into CUI category
>
> * Investigation documents
> * Inspection reports
> * Agency budgetary information
> * Procurement bids/proposals
> * Personally identifiable information \(PII\)
> * Information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974
>
>
>
> **Safeguarding Classified and CUI**
>
> ![safe2.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255832/preview)You must protect and safeguard classified information and CUI all times. The requirements for classified documents are different from CUI ones:
>
> Classified Information
>
> * GSA approved container
> * Vaults and secure rooms
> * Secure systems
> * Maintain control and never leave unattended
> * Do not divulge to unauthorized persons
>
> CUI
>
> * Locked cabinets
> * Rooms with locked outer office doors
> * Key or cipher locked rooms
>
> **What if you find classified information or CUI unattended or unsecured?**
>
> There are two things you should do if you find unattended or unsecured classified information or CUI:
>
> * Secure the information by personal control or placing in an approved storage area OR
> * Immediately contact your supervisor, commander, Information Protection Office, security manager assistant security manager or security assistant

### Violations

> Security laws and regulations require sanctions if you do not follow the policies, standards, and procedures developed to help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of classified information. You may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions if you knowingly, willfully, or negligently have any of the following issues:
>
> * Disclose classified information to unauthorized persons
> * Classify or continue the classification of information in violation of DoD regulations
> * Create or continue a Special Access Program \(SAP\) contrary to the requirements of DoD regulations
> * Disclose controlled CUI to unauthorized persons
> * Violate any other provision of applicable DoD regulations
>
> Actions that may be taken against you if you compromise protected information include, but are not limited to:
>
> * Warning
> * Reprimand
> * Loss or denial of classified access
> * Suspension without pay
> * Removal from employment
> * Discharge from military service
> * Criminal prosecution

### Public Release of Information

> DoD policy requires a certain processes are adhered to concerning DoD information intended for public release. Carefully read these requirements and keep them in mind if you are responsible for doing so at some point in your career.
>
> Release of any government information must be approved by the Public Affairs Office \(PAO\):
>
> * Books, manuscript, or articles sent to the publisher, editor, movie producer, or game purveyor, or their respective support staffs
> * Speech, briefing, article, or content that will be publicly disseminated
> * Information released to the public, even through Congress or the courts
>
> Do not discuss classified or sensitive material with the media:
>
> * Do not confirm or deny
> * Do not respond to questions about programs or projects
> * Refer inquiries to your local PAO
>
> Contacts:
>
> * Information Protection Office
> * Supervisor
> * Security Manager
> * Assistant Security Manager
> * Security Assistant
> * Supervisor

### OPSEC Operations Security

> The first type of security condition you need to be aware of is Operations Security, or OPSEC. OPSEC is designed to protect information on operational activities from adversaries. What type of information are we talking about? Things like organizational changes or operational movements such as moving certain aircraft from Andrews Air Force Base to Hurlburt Field. Additionally, things like changes in work hours such as noticing there was a lot of activity in the head office extending into the night. By itself, a piece of information may not be useful, but when pieced together with other information, it could provide useful clues for our adversaries. Simply put, be aware of your surroundings and protect operational information.

### FPCON Force Protection Cnodition

> The second security condition, FPCON, or Force Protection Condition, is a five level system to protect Air Force personnel and facilities. Starting with FPCON normal, the system successively increases posture to meet threats. However, the level may not be implemented successively depending on the threat. Below is more information on each FPCON level.
>
> ![FPCON Normal.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255811/preview)
>
> A green FPCON Normal sign will be posted on military building doorways. When posted, no security concern is expected at the time, but personnel should always be vigilant.
>
> ![FPCON A.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255825/preview)
>
> Service members will be instructed to inform their family members of the circumstances leading to FPCON Alpha. Everyone should be alert to and report suspicious activities such as unfamiliar personnel, vehicles, suspicious packages and possible surveillance attempts to security personnel.
>
> ![FPCON B.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255819/preview)
>
> An increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists. You can expect delays at gates and possible gate closures. You can also expect tightening of visitor entry procedures, the possibility of a flex-time work schedule, increased internal security, and be prepared for parking restrictions around facilities.
>
> ![FPCON C.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255888/preview)
>
> This condition applies when an incident has occurred or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Implementation of measures in FPCON Charlie for longer than short periods may create hardships and affect the activities of the units and their personnel.
>
> ![FPCON D-1.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255851/preview)
>
> FPCON Delta is the most severe level. Movement is restricted to essential movements only. Service members and their families should limit their movement to absolutely necessary until the FPCON level changes. Many services and facilities will be limited or closed in Delta.

### INFOCON Information Operations Condition

> Organized much like FPCON, our third security condition is Information Operations Condition or INFOCON. INFOCON is a defense system based primarily on the status of information systems, and is a method used by the military to defend against a computer network attack. The INFOCON system provides commanders the authority, discretion, and accountability to prepare their organization's network in information systems at any level appropriate for the current environment. It also has five levels associated with it and each level progresses to increasingly higher threats and security measures. 
>
> See below for a detailed description of each INFOCON level.  
>
>
> ![ic5.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255827/preview)**INFOCON 5**
>
> Validation Cycle: 180 Days
>
> Routine NetOps: Normal readiness of information systems and networks that can be sustained indefinitely.
>
> Information networks are fully operational in a known baseline condition with standard information assurance policies in place and enforced. 
>
> System and network administrators will create and maintain a snapshot baseline of each server and workstation in a known good configuration and develop processes to update that baseline for authorized changes.
>
> ![ic4.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255826/preview)**INFOCON 4**
>
> Validation Cycle: 90 Days
>
> Increased Vigilance: In preparations for operations or exercises, with a limited impact to the end-user.
>
> System and network rhythm to validate the known good image of an information network against the current state and identify unauthorized changes.
>
> Additionally, user profiles and accounts are reviewed and checks conducted for dormant accounts. 
>
> ![ic3.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255828/preview)**INFOCON 3**
>
> Validation Cycle: 60 Days
>
> Enhanced Readiness: Increases the frequency of of validation of information networks and its corresponding configuration. Impact to the end-user is minor.
>
> ![ic2.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255902/preview)**INFOCON 2**
>
> Validation Cycle: 30 Days
>
> Greater Readiness: Increases the frequency of validation and information networks and its corresponding configuration.
>
> Impact to administrators will increase and impact to end-users could be significant.
>
> The impact on system administrators will increase in comparison to INFOCON 3 and will require an increase in pre-planning, personnel training, and the exercising and pre-positioning of system rebuilding utilities.
>
> ![ic1.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255820/preview)**INFOCON 1**
>
> Validation Cycle: 15 Days
>
> Maximum Readiness: Addresses intrusion techniques that cannot be identified or defeated at lower readiness levels.
>
> Only implemented in limited cases. Could be a significant impact on administrators and end-users.
>
> This is the highest readiness condition. The most effective method for ensuring the system has not been compromised in this manner is to reload operating system software on key infrastructure servers \(e.g., domain controllers, exchange servers, etc.\) from an accurate baseline.

## Force Development

> To keep pace with the changing environment and help civilians with continually developing, the Air Force has created a more deliberate and robust approach to developing the civilian workforce. This process is designed to develop and sustain a civilian workforce with diverse skills.
>
> The goal of civilian force development is to develop and sustain a civilian workforce that will:
>
> * Perform essential technical and occupational functions
> * Serve in leadership roles in multiple environments
> * Provide a competitive cadre of candidates prepared to fill key leadership

### Governing Documents

> The Air Force has several documents that codify this development approach. These three are the important pieces that help us create the framework. They outline the basic framework and define the three levels of leadership, tactical expertise, operational competence and strategic vision required to produce skilled,  knowledgeable, and competent Airmen.
>
> They include force development policy statements, directives, goals, expected outcomes of force development, and codify the use of competencies that apply to all Airmen.
>
> They further provide the instruction to develop competencies in all Airmen through education, training, and  experience opportunities, and instruct Air Force leaders on leveraging the civilian development continuum,  which we will discuss later in this course. These documents establish the overall construct and provide functional community leaders with career path templates.

### Competency Models

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will be an interesting read for later!
{% endhint %}

> Competency models are an organized collection of various competencies describing observable and measurable patterns of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics required to perform the mission successfully. Competency models provide a framework to effectively assess, maintain, and monitor the competencies required for mission success.
>
> Competency models used within the context of total force development enable the Air Force to maintain or modify its assignment, classification, learning and development, recruitment, retention, and other talent management policies, strategies, operations, tactics, procedures, and techniques to meet mission requirements.
>
> Competency models used within the context of the continuum of learning enable Airmen to identify competency gaps and determine the education, training, and experiences needed to meet mission requirements
>

### Functional and Occupational Competencies

> Functional/Occupational competencies are the knowledge, skills and abilities related to specific career field duties. They are focused on building depth of functional experience specific to areas of expertise that enable individuals to successfully perform their unique duties. They are continually under review by the various functional career field managers and sometimes rapidly evolving as the result of fielding a new weapon system or capability.  
>
> They take experiences and challenges to the different career fields, broadening as someone continues to serve. For example, if you are in the logistics career field, you may need to enhance your knowledge of production management, material management, or weapon systems program management.

### Development Levels

> **THIS PAGE IS JUST A PLACE HOLDER UNTIL WE RECEIVE THE UPDATED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM SLIDE/KEY.** 
>
> Here are the force development levels of Tactical Expertise, Operational Competence, and  Strategic Vision.  You need to understand these levels in order to understand the overall force development framework.               
>
> At the Tactical Expertise level, Airmen master their primary duty skills, learn to apply those skills, and gain an understanding of team leadership. At the Operational level, Airmen are able to understand the broader Air Force perspective and the integration of diverse people and their capabilities to execute operations.   At the Strategic Vision level, Airmen combine highly developed personal and people/team competencies. They develop a deep understanding of Air Force capabilities and how Airmen achieve synergistic results and desired effects with their operational capabilities. They also understand how the Air Force operates within joint, multinational, and interagency relationships. At this level, an Airman’s required competencies transition from the integration of people with missions to leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations.
>
> To help civilians understand the framework better, the Air Force created the Civilian Continuum of Learning, a roadmap for civilian leadership development. 
>
> These levels will be a continuing theme throughout this lesson.

### Leadership Development

> To help Airmen better understand the leadership development framework, the Air Force created the Civilian Development Continuum, a roadmap for civilian leadership development. 
>
> It is a guide to your professional and leadership development. When using this guide, it is important to remember the following: civilian development is a personal choice and it depends on your desire to seek development opportunities. The Air Force expects civilians to continually develop themselves throughout their careers.
>
> The continuum is read from bottom to top, and left to right. Programs are situated on the continuum based on development level expectations, and are categorized as Foundational and Targeted development. It is entirely based on your position, career group or grade, and experience. If you are a GS1 through 8 or equivalent, you would look at the tactical expertise level. If you are a GS 9 through 13 or equivalent, you would look at the operational competence level, and if you are a GS 14 and up or equivalent, you would look at the strategic vision level.
>
> The Air Force expects all civilians, no matter the development level focus, to complete foundational development. It all begins with the New Employee Orientation Course, a computer based training that provides civilians with basic Air Force knowledge to include: heritage, mission, core values, and customs and courtesies. That foundational development moves ahead using continuous self-development in the form of developed management and leadership learning programs through the Virtual Force Development Center.  
>
> The Air Force has an expectation that civilians aspiring for greater responsibility complete the appropriate non residence professional military education, such as Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and Air War College. Once again, it is a personal choice that depends on your desire to develop.

## Roles and Responsibilities

> In this final section, we will touch on some specific topics that will help make your own career development activities more successful. We will briefly explain the supervisor and employee roles as they relate to career development, as well as the role of a mentor. We will also provide some career planning steps, and finally, tools available to assist with career planning and development.

### Role of the Supervisor

> The supervisor's role is key to force development. Supervisors should: 
>
> * Help you understand the benefits of development
> * Participate in your development process
> * **Offer guidance and mentoring** to help you achieve mission goals
> * Acknowledge your achievements, strengths, and areas for improvement
> * Document short and long term goals and develop a plan based on your specific needs
> * Encourage team members to take opportunities for development

### Your \(My\) Role

> While your supervisor will play an important role, he or she does not have all the responsibility. You must also be an active participant in the career development process. The continuum serves as a guide and there are tools available to assist you, but you, and the decisions you make, will ultimately determine just how successful you are at reaching your goals.  
>
> Individual Development Plan \(**IDP**\). IDPs are designed for federal employees who want to improve performance in their current position, develop skills/abilities that could enhance their promotion potential in their career field or another career field, or prepare them for managerial/supervisory positions.
>
> An **IDP is a written plan and schedule designed to meet employee’s particular developmental goals.** They provide a systematic method of planning for training and gaining experience in order to develop specific skills and knowledge needed to meet your short and long term career goals.
>
> IDPs will be used by you and your supervisor to plan training and related developmental experiences \(details, special projects, on-the-job training \(OJT\), etc.\). They can change from year to year, and their primary purpose is to help you establish reasonable goals, assess your particular strengths, and evaluate progress relative to those goals.
>
> IDPs are not mandatory except for certain supervisory and development programs including perspective Senior Executive Service \(SES\) applicants. However, all agencies encourage employees to participate in the IDP process. It is, however, required that supervisors advise, discuss, and participate in the development of IDPs with their employees who do not specifically decline it.
>
> Again, remember the expectation is to continually develop throughout your career. Take CHARGE of your own development.
>
> * Be realistic when developing your plan
> * Develop your individual development plan \(IDP\)
> * Identify career goals, education, training and experiences that will get you there
> * Use the available career development tools
> * BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT!
> * Receive supervisor input and feedback

### Mentoring

Mentoring is a relationship between two individuals based on a mutual desire for development towards career goals and objectives. The role of a mentor is very important. Take a few minutes to read about some key factors of mentoring.

* Involves having “A trusted counselor or guide”
* Normally a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person
* AF has a mentor network where the member can share a development plan with a mentor or multiple mentors
* Mentors will have the ability to view career progress, then provide feedback and advice

### Planning Development

> Because development is on-going, it is important to have a process to plan. To do this, there are FOUR basic steps:
>
> * Identify personal capabilities and job requirements
> * Discuss the functional and **institutional competencies** with your supervisor, and if applicable, your mentor or mentors
> * Create a development plan using the Civilian Development Continuum, My VECTOR, and the Virtual Force Development Center.
> * Use My VECTOR to track progress, capture programs completed, and review personnel data. 
>
> Remember, it starts with you. We will now move on to discuss other available tools and websites to assist you in planning your future development.

### My Vector

My VECTOR is an enterprise solution that supports the Air Force's goal to provide a standardized process available to all Airmen for career development and selecting mentors. The Air Force hopes to nurture and sustain Airmen's growth throughout their entire career.

### Virtual Force Development Center

> Another valuable tool for your development is the Virtual Force Development Center. It is located on the Air Force Portal, and can be accessed by going to the Force Development Page, then simply click Virtual Force Development navigation pane. It contains a collection of educational materials to support continuous supervisory and leadership development. To meet this objective, the Virtual Force Development Center has a vast array of links to useful documents, learning programs, courses, videos, books and much more, all of them focused around the Air Force **institutional competencies**. It gives you the ability to meet your expectation for continuous development.

### Air Force e-Learning

> The largest asset linked from the virtual force Development Center is Air Force e-Learning. This is a resource containing learning programs based on the Air Force Institutional Competencies, as well as articles, books, and more. This site can also be accessed from the Air Force Portal home page by selecting the Air Force e-Learning link underneath the career and training tab. From there, simply put in a topic or subject in the search engine, and the site will display courses, simulations, exercises, and books based on the information you provided.
>
> This site can also be accessed from the Air Force Portal home page by selecting the Air Force e-Learning link underneath the Top Portal Links block. From there, simply put in a topic or subject in the search engine, and the site will display courses, simulations, exercises, and books based on the information you provided. For example, if you put Managing Change in the search engine, the site displays over two thousand nine hundred items for educational use.
>
> For questions regarding this site, see your Force Support Squadron \(FSS\) Force Development Flight or your supervisor.

### USAF Civilian Development School

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

> **Mission:** Provide Air Force civilian leadership, management, behavioral and air-power subjects through an undergraduate program and professional continuing education courses to deliberately develop AF Civilians in alignment with the law, DoD Supervisor/Manager framework, and AETC’s continuum of learning.
>
> **Vision:** The first choice for developing and executing Air Force Civilian Education and Training. 
>
> We believe Civilian Development is a deliberate process based on a career-long Continuum of Learning.  We execute the civilian development through the use of the Civilian Supervisory/Managerial and Leadership Development Continuum.  This learning continuum is designed to on-command \(required\) and on-demand \(voluntary\) development opportunities throughout the various phases of a civilian employee's career.  Courses are adaptive to the Air Force's ever changing environment and responsive to the needs of both our functional leaders and students.  We believe that civilian employees are a vital component of the Total Force and investing in the continuous development of our civilian employees is critical to achieving the Air Force mission.  The courses and programs that comprise the continuum of learning is based on an integrated concept where each course builds upon each previous course, ensuring we deliver deliberate education at the right time and place in each individual's career.
>
> **The Continuum:**            
>
> * _Provides a road map for development through voluntary leadership development opportunities and mandatory supervisory and managerial training for civilians and supervisors of civilian employees_ 
> * _Provides an Air Force-sponsored and funded Associate Degree opportunity through the annual Civilian Developmental Education \(CDE\) call to allow civilian to earn an Associate Degree with little-to-no cost_
> * _Provides self-paced as well as blended learning programs that enable continuous learning and development and support student learning outcomes established within each course_
> * _Synchronizes civilian institutional leadership development programs to better align with other learning opportunities such as PME and CDE_
> * _Clarifies what the Air Force values in leadership development for civilians_
> * _Links civilian development to our **AF institutional competencies**_
> * _Establishes requirements and expectations for civilian development._ 
>
> **How do I read/use the continuum?**
>
> Courses on the continuum are categorized as either on-command \(mandatory\) or on-demand \(voluntary\) development.  The Air Force expects all civilian employees to complete on-command development at the appropriate time based on the employee's current level of experience in the  Air Force and within their specific position, career group or grade.  On-demand development provides additional opportunities for civilians who desire additional development that may enhance their opportunity for advancement or to serve in positions of increased responsibility. 
>
> Civilian Development begins the moment an individual accepts employment with the Air Force.  This is shown on the left side of the Continuum as "**Orientation**."  The New Employee Orientation course provides new Air Force civilian employees with orientation to the Air Force organizational environment and knowledge and appreciation USAF civilian culture.  
>
> After Orientation and continuing from left to right, the Air Force provides on-demand **Leadership Development** opportunities for employees who desire to establish, improve or enhance their leadership skills and abilities.  The competencies taught in these optional courses are based on Air Force **institutional competencies** and have varying degrees of eligibility, requirements, and expectations based on the employee's current development and experience level.  The **USAF Emerging Leader** course is for employees with no leadership experience, but have a desire to establish their own individual leadership style and capabilities. The **USAF Developing Team Leader** course is for civilian employees who wish to develop their capability to lead small teams of employees that have been formed to accomplish a specific mission.  Finally, the **USAF Developing Organizational Leader** course is for more experienced employees who wish to develop the capability to lead more complex positions within an organizational setting, such as Flight Chief or Squadron Director positions at the installation/wing-level or a Branch or Division Chief at the headquarters/staff-level.
>
> The courses that comprise **Supervisory and Managerial Development** are all mandatory courses based upon the supervisory status associated with the employee's current position.  These courses are designed to provide initial and recurring supervisory and managerial training for personnel assigned to first-level, second-level and senior-level supervisory/managerial positions.  These mandatory courses ensure compliance with 5 USC Section 412 and are designed to deliver the right education at the appropriate time based on each individual supervisor's experience level.
>
> _**Below the Supervisory & Management Development and Leadership Development paths are voluntary courses and links to material you can use throughout your career:**_
>
> The first block provides information on the Civilian Associate of Applied Science Degree in AF Leadership and Management Studies. This is a new program that was offered for the first time Air Force-wide in the Civilian Development Education call that was released in March 2017.  This program is the first degree program in the Air Force designed specifically for civilian employees.  The program is open to all permanent appropriated fund employees in all grades, career series and pay systems.  New civilians aren't eligible until they pass their 2 year probationary period.  More information and eligibility requirements can be found on [the AAS website.Links to an external site.](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Eaker-Center/FSPDS/Display/Article/1088474/)
>
> The second block identifies a host of programs that enable learning for employees at any stage of their career or development.  The virtual Force Development Center \(vFDC\) is located on the Air Force Portal and is available 24/7.  Every Airmen is encouraged to visit the vFDC as it is a one-stop site that links to numerous self-development and institutional force development resources.  You can find links to all the courses identified on this continuum on the[ vFDC web site \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s0ECF2BB84DBEAE7B014DD46E712201EF).   \(Requires CAC access\)

### Force Development is Multidimensional

> * The Air Force prepares Airmen for leadership
> * Experience blended with skills, knowledge, and motivation, refines occupational skills and enduring **leadership competencies**
> * Deliberate career planning and development prepare Airmen to meet mission requirements
> * The Air Force leverages competencies

### Work Schedule

> **Hours of Duty**
>
> * Generally, work is scheduled on the same hours each day
> * Changes in individual workdays and shifts may be made when dictated to meet operational requirements
> * Notice must be given when employees are to be assigned to a different tour of duty or to different hours of work
> * Advance notice requirements vary from installation to installation due to union-management negotiated agreements
>
> Please consult your supervisor regarding your tour of duty.
>
> #### ![scheduling.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255787/preview)**Types of Schedules**
>
> * Full-Time - Typical 40 hours during the workweek
> * Part-Time - A schedule less than full- time, but for a specific number of hours \(usually 16-32 hours workweek\)
> * Job Sharing - When two employees voluntarily share the duties and responsibilities of a full-time position. Job sharers are part- time employees
> * Intermittent - No prearranged work schedule
> * On-Call - Works when needed less than 6 months per year
> * Seasonal - Works on an annually recurring basis for periods of less than 12 months
>
> ![alternate work schedule.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255755/preview)**Alternate Work Schedules**
>
> * Alternative Work Schedules \(AWS\) can help managers as well as the employees
> * Decision to establish an AWS program is at the discretion of the installation commander
>
> There are two categories of AWS:
>
> * Flexible Work Schedules
> * Compressed Work Schedules
>
> ![Flexible\_Work.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255800/preview)**Flexible Work Schedules**
>
> * Some employees may work a Flexible Work Schedule which consists of workdays with:
> * Core hours
> * Flexible hours
> * Core hours are the designated period of the day when all employees must be at work
> * Flexible hours are the part of the workday when employees may \(within limits\) choose their time of arrival and departure, set by their managers
>
> ![DID-YOU-SAY-A-COMPRESSED-WORK-WEEK-SCHEDULE-.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255793/preview)**Compressed Work Schedules**
>
> * Full-time employee basic work requirement is 80 hours in a biweekly pay period
> * Part-time employee requirement is less than 80 hours that may be scheduled for less than 10 workdays
>
> Two types of compressed work schedules are:
>
> * Four-day work week - A full-time employee must work 10 hours a day, 40 hours a week, and 80 hours a biweekly pay period. The agency head determines the number of hours a part-time employee must work in a 4-day workweek and the number of hours in a biweekly pay period
> * 5-4/9 Plan - A full-time employee works eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day for a total of 80 hours in a biweekly pay period. The agency head determines the number of hours a part-time employee must work in a 9-day biweekly pay period
>
> ![Telework\_Goals-mac.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255783/preview)**Telework**
>
> The Telework Enhancement Act defines telework or teleworking as a work flexibility arrangement under which an employee performs the duties and responsibilities of such employee's position, and other authorized activities, from an approved worksite other than the location from which the employee would otherwise work.  In practice, telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to perform work, during any part of regular, paid hours, at an approved alternative worksite \(e.g. home or telework center\).
>
> #### **Temporary appointments**
>
> There are many types of temporary appointments, but the two most common are term and temporary and appointments. These appointments are expected to last for a stated specified period with a not-to-exceed date.
>
> * Term appointments [\(5 CFR Subpart C - TERM 316.301 - 304\) \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2dcabde4fe239851fad276675048dd1e&mc=true&node=sp5.1.316.c&rgn=div6) : Time limited for at least one year but not to exceed four years.
> * Temporary appointment[ \(5 CFR  Subpart D - Temporary 316.401 - 403\) \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=3b56835b48a8aef42dd2a671e35e454d&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title05/5cfr316_main_02.tpl) : Time limited not to exceed one year but could be less.
>
> Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do **not** give the employee competitive/permanent status.
>
> **Distinctions between Temporary, Seasonal, and Intermittent Employees**
>
> Temporary appointments are used to fill positions when there is no permanent need for an employee's services. For example, a temporary appointment can be used to fill a position that is not expected to last more than one year, or to meet an employment need that is scheduled to be terminated within one or two years for reasons such as an agency's reorganization or abolishment, or the completion of a specific project or peak workload.
>
> Temporary employees are eligible to earn leave and are covered by Social Security and unemployment compensation, but do not receive the other benefits provided to career civil service employees. As discussed later in my testimony, temporary employees can purchase health insurance after they have completed one year of temporary service; however, the employee must pay for the full cost of the health insurance with no Government contribution. Furthermore, these employees are generally ineligible for coverage under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program \(FEGLI\) or the Federal employees' retirement systems.
>
> The terms "seasonal" and "intermittent" relate to employees' work schedules and not the appointment type used to hire them. Seasonal and intermittent employees can therefore be either permanent employees or temporary employees. Seasonal temporary employees receive the same benefits as other temporary employees. Permanent seasonal employees allow agencies to develop an experienced cadre of employees utilizing permanent appointment authorities. These seasonal employees perform their duties on a recurring basis every year. Seasonal employment is appropriate when the work is expected to last at least six months or more during a calendar year. Recurring work that lasts less than six months is best performed by temporary employees. Consistent with the career nature of their appointments, permanent seasonal employees receive the same benefits offered to the rest of the Federal civil service.
>
> Intermittent employees are best suited for work that is sporadic and unpredictable, allowing agencies to utilize them in emergencies or when a work schedule is difficult to define. Temporary intermittent employees are generally ineligible for participation in most Federal employee benefit programs. In contrast, permanent intermittent employees are eligible for participation in Federal employees' retirement systems.

### Compensation

> The federal employee compensation package is more than just salary. The Federal Government offers competitive base pay, with most positions using the General Schedule \(GS\) pay system. Some highly-competitive jobs, such as entry-level IT specialists, provide higher special pay rates. In addition to salary, your hiring agency may offer monetary recruitment, relocation, or retention incentives and performance awards. Also, agencies may help repay your Federally-insured student loans up to a maximum of $10,000 a year or a $60,000 lifetime maximum.
>
> Agencies have the flexibility to tailor compensation and benefits packages to be competitive with other employers. Eligibility for benefits depends on the type of position you hold and whether your position is full-time, part-time, or intermittent. Contact the hiring agency for more information on the specific compensation and benefits offered.
>
> Compensation may be in the form of:
>
> * Salary
> * Incentives and awards
> * Special entitlements
> * Injury compensation
> * Merit promotion
>   * A change of an employee from one grade to a higher grade
>   * Two-step promotion rule
>   * Geographic conversion rule

### Federal Wage System

> The Federal Wage System covers employees performing work in craft, trade, and labor occupations. Employees under the FWS earn hourly pay versus an annual salary. FWS positions are assigned to one of three pay categories:
>
> * Wage Grade \(WG\)
> * Wage Leader \(WL\)
> * Wage Supervisor \(WS\)
>
> Pay increases for FWS positions are based on the prevailing rate for similar work in the local area.

### Performance Management

> Performance management \(PM\)translates organizational goals into results. While many relate it to end of year appraisals, PM encompasses much more than that. PM also focuses not only on the individual employees, but also on teams, programs, processes and the organization as a whole.  
>
> Performance involves:
>
> * Planning work and setting expectations
> * Monitoring performance continually
> * Evaluating performance
> * Recognizing and rewarding good performance

### Performance Management Program

> Performance management \(PM\) is comprised of three phases: planning, monitoring and evaluation. Planning performance is the critical first phase to a successful PM process and is essential to achieving and sustaining a high-performance culture. During planning, the supervisor establishes and clearly communicates performance expectations. It's important to remember that this is a cycle. The emphasis of this program is on continual and timely planning, monitoring and evaluating throughout the performance appraisal cycle. The final performance appraisal discussion session should be a summary of discussions that have occurred throughout the year.
>
> **Planning**
>
> ![planning.png](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255784/preview)Planning performance is the critical first phase to a successful performance management process and is essential to achieving and sustaining a high-performance culture. During planning, the supervisor and employee establishes performance expectations geared toward achieving organizational goals.  Each performance plan identifies specific performance elements that have been established for the employee and for which the employee will be held accountable. REMEMBER: Supervisors and employees share responsibility for planning performance.
>
> **Monitoring**
>
> ![monitoring.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255796/preview)In the second phase supervisors are monitoring assignments and projects continually and consistently to measure performance and provide ongoing feedback to employees on progress toward reaching their goals. In addition to providing feedback whenever exceptional or ineffective performance is observed, supervisors should provide periodic feedback about day-to-day accomplishments and contributions. During the monitoring phase, communication is critical and an important determinant of success of the employee and supervisor. For feedback to be effective,  communication must be meaningful, two-way  and be a joint responsibility of both supervisors and employees.
>
> **Evaluating**
>
> ![evaluating.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255801/preview)Evaluating performance means rating employee performance against the elements and standards in an employee’s performance plan and assigning a rating of record. Supervisors are required to rate each performance element based on an approved plan and provide a rating of record for each employee who has been under an approved performance plan for at least 90 calendar days during the appraisal cycle. A written rating of record must be given to each employee after the end of the appraisal cycle and is based on work performed during the appraisal cycle.

### Key Program Management Program Features

> Key features of the DPMAP:
>
> * The appraisal cycle runs 1 April through 31 March
> * DPMAP requires a minimum of 3 performance discussions \(more are recommended\)
> * There is a three-level rating pattern
>   * 5 - Outstanding
>   * 3 - Fully successful
>   * 1 - Unacceptable
>
> The process is collaborative:
>
> * Requires supervisor and employee engagement
> * Supervisors provide instruction, but employees are encouraged to provide feedback
> * Upward feedback
>
> The process requires open communication:
>
> * Supervisors and employees, when effectively collaborating, can greatly impact organizational effectiveness
> * Open communication is beneficial to building employee engagement

> Key Features of DCIPS
>
> DCIPS is designed to create a performance culture in which the performance and contributions of the workforce are linked to mission. Making meaningful distinctions between levels of performance and rewarding performance according to those distinctions helps to drive performance. Under DCIPS, how work is accomplished is just as important as what is accomplished. Employees are rated on both aspects through the use of performance objectives and performance elements. **Evaluation period: 1 October – 30 September**
>
> Performance objectives express performance expectations. They are the "what" of job performance. They communicate major individual, team, and organizational responsibilities or contributions and related outcomes and accomplishments. They capture the large buckets of an employee's work and are essentially what needs to be accomplished. For performance objectives to become a meaningful appraisal tool, they have to be appropriate to the pay band and position of the individual.
>
> Performance elements are attributes of job performance that are significant to accomplishing individual performance objectives. They are the "how" of job performance. They can act as a guide on the path to accomplishing the job. The DCIPS performance management process uses the following six performance elements.
>
> * Accountability for Results
> * Communication
> * Critical Thinking
> * Engagement and Collaboration
> * Personal Leadership and Integrity
> * Technical Expertise
>
> Key Features of AcqDemo
>
> AcqDemo is a congressionally-mandated project designed for the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics \(AT&L\) workforce to provide employees with a flexible, responsive personnel system that rewards employee contribution and provides line managers with greater authority over personnel actions. AcqDemo is designed to attract, motivate, and retain high-quality AT&L professionals. **Evaluation period: 1 October – 30 September**
>
> The AcqDemo’s performance management system \(Contribution-Based Compensation and Appraisal System\) is designed to make employee compensation consistent with their level of contribution to the mission of the organization. Employees are rated on the following six factors.
>
> * Career path and broadband level
> * Contribution Factors \(Problem Solving, Teamwork/Cooperation, Customer Relations, Leadership/Supervision, Communication, and Resource Management\)
> * Expected Overall Contribution Score \(EOCS\)
> * Organization mission
> * Expected contribution and expected results
> * Professional/career development \(IDP\)
>
> Performance management has universal concepts that are inherent in the various civilian systems used in the Air Force. Federal law mandates the use of codified personnel management programs, and at their core, they need to plan, monitor, develop, evaluate, and recognize and reward employee performance. More importantly, the performance should link to the respective organization’s mission and goals. The various major systems used in the Air Force reinforce the need for that linkage and place considerable emphasis on the employee—supervisory relationship in terms of establishing the plan and conducting two-way communication throughout the evaluation period.

### Supervisor and Employee Roles and Responsibilities

> Employees can help their supervisors be more effective when they feel a sense of ownership in the organization and engage in open communication about how to improve organizational effectiveness and employee engagement.
>
> Supervisors need to understand how employees accomplish work, which provides information on how to best support them. There can be differences between how supervisors perceive the strengths and areas for improvement of employees versus how employees perceive their own performance. There is no process in the current program to ensure stakeholder awareness of the gaps for collaborative resolution.
>
> This process consists of three roles for employees:
>
> ![TeamEvent.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255758/preview)Team Empowerment: Sharing the load of team management with the supervisor by being an active partner in the team. Employees can help a supervisor manage the team by:
>
> * Helping to maintain team cohesion
> * Understanding what others on the team do
> * Sharing their sense of the team’s strengths and areas for improvement
> * Sharing their understanding of the team’s biggest challenges
>
> ![upward coaching.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255757/preview)Upward Coaching: Transparency into how the work gets done.
>
> * Helping the supervisor understand both the team’s and their responsibilities
> * Sharing the best informal ways of getting things done
> * Sharing the team’s long-term work goals
> * Teaching their supervisor a new skill, concept, process, or procedure
>
> ![Feedback.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255764/preview)Upward Feedback: Communicating about the supervisor’s effectiveness in engaging employees:
>
> * Giving their supervisors constructive feedback
> * Providing feedback on their supervisors’ ideas
> * Sharing their understanding of supervisors’ strengths and areas for improvement
>
> This collaborative engagement by employees has the potential to increase the effectiveness of the supervisor and the productivity of the work unit. It is important for supervisors to facilitate the process of employees engaging in these activities. For example, supervisors can ask employees for their feedback and discuss with them how the feedback will be used. This open communication, in addition to increasing supervisory effectiveness, has the added benefit of building employee engagement because employees feel a sense of ownership in the organization when they see that their input is valued.
>
> Regardless of the specific method used, it is most effective if there is a trusting supervisor-employee relationship in place.

### Supervisor-Employee Engagement

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

> Supervisor-employee engagement is key to a high-performance work environment. For employees to be engaged, they must be able to communicate openly with their supervisors. This provides a powerful opportunity to actively engage in frequent communication between employee and supervisor about accomplishments, current work, and future goals. Employees should arrange a time to meet with their supervisor to discuss the following topics:

### Performance Management Summary

> Performance management is centered on supervisors engaging with their employees to plan, monitor, and evaluate employee performance. This includes but is not limited to providing constructive feedback, address training and development needs, and recognize and reward performance when appropriate. It involves more “soft” concepts such as building trust throughout the workforce; establishing credibility, transparency, and equity in the processes; treating employees fairly; and increasing accountability. When executed properly, performance management practices can greatly increase employee commitment, engagement, and performance. As you progress in your orientation, you will learn more about how this performance management model works for your supervisor and you.

### Whistle-blower: Mandatory Prohibited Personnel Practices

> The President signed into law last year two pieces of legislation changing the requirements that apply to agencies on issues surrounding prohibited personnel practices.  
> Accordingly, this announcement is designed to make you aware of some of the changes, found in the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 20171 and Office of Special Counsel Reauthorization Act of 2017, passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 \(NDAA\).2  
>
>
> New Prohibited Personnel Practice:  Pursuant to the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, it is now a prohibited personnel practice to “access the medical record of another employee or an applicant for employment as a part of, or otherwise in furtherance of, any conduct described in paragraphs \(1\) through \(13\)” of 5 U.S.C. § 2302\(b\).4  
>   
> New Employees:  The previous 5 U.S.C. § 2302\(c\), with its accompanying OSC Certification Program, is redesignated under 2302\(d\). In its place, the new section requires that the head of each agency ensure, in consultation with OSC and the inspector general of the agency, that employees of the agency are informed of the rights and remedies available under § 2302 and chapter 12 of Title 5.6 The agency must provide this information to each new employee no later than 180 days after the date on which the new employee is appointed.7  
>   
> Supervisors:  The head of each agency, in consultation with OSC and the inspector general of the agency \(or senior ethics official if the agency has no inspector general\), shall provide annual training to supervisors regarding how to respond to complaints alleging a violation of whistleblower protections.8 Additionally, the agency shall provide such training to new supervisors.9  
>   
> Supervisors’ Performance Appraisals:  The head of each agency, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and OSC, must develop criteria that promote the protection of whistleblowers as a critical element for establishing the job duties of all supervisory employees.10 The criteria must include principles for the protection of whistleblowers, such as the degree to which supervisory employees respond constructively when employees make protected disclosures, how supervisors take responsible actions to resolve these disclosures, and ways in which the supervisors foster an environment in which employees of the agency feel comfortable making such disclosures.  
>   
> Required Discipline:  Both new laws establish required discipline for supervisors found to have committed a prohibited personnel action which is defined as the taking or failing to take an action in violation of 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302\(b\)\(8\), \(b\)\(9\) or \(b\)\(14\).13 The new provision states: 
>
>   
> Subject to section 1214\(f\),14 if the head of the agency in which a supervisor is employed, an administrative law judge, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Special Counsel, a judge of the United States, or the Inspector General of the agency in which a supervisor is employed has determined that the supervisor committed a prohibited personnel action, the head of the agency in which the supervisor is employed, consistent with the procedures required under paragraph \(2\)—
>
>   
> \(A\) for the first prohibited personnel action committed by the supervisor—
>
> \(i\) shall propose suspending the supervisor for a period that is not less than 3 days; and  
> \(ii\) may propose an additional action determined appropriate by the head of the agency, including a reduction in grade or pay; and
>
>   
> \(B\) for the second prohibited personnel action committed by the supervisor, shall propose removing the supervisor.15

## Drugs

### Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program

> Using illegal drugs, on or off-duty, is inconsistent with the behavior expected ALL Air Force employees as servants of the public. Just as the Air Force expects its active-duty members to refrain from illegal drug use, it expects no less from its civilian employees. The Air Force Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program is designed to improve the health, wellness and safety of the civilian force. This program is designed to deter the use and abuse of controlled and illegal substances through a comprehensive program of education, prevention, and drug testing.
>
> **Objective:** To provide a basic knowledge of the AF Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program \(AFCDDRP\).    
>
> This section will cover the following topics:
>
> * Air Force Instructions \(AFI\) relevant to the AFCDDRP
> * Air Force Policy on Civilian Drug Use
> * Testing Designated Positions \(TDP\)
> * Major drug categories and the symptoms of drug abuse/misuse.
> * Administrative/disciplinary actions that result from illicit drug use
> * Employee confidentiality policies and limitations
> * Available counseling, assistance, and referral support programs

### Air Force Policy on Civilian Drug Use

> Executive Order 12564, Drug-Free Federal Workplace, requires federal employees to refrain using illegal drugs. The order proclaims that using illegal drugs, whether on duty or off duty, is contrary to the efficiency of the service. Air Force Instruction 90-508, Air Force Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program, establishes the Air Force’s Civilian Drug Testing Program objectives, policies, procedures, and implementing guidelines. The AFCDTP is designed to achieve a drug-free workplace, consistent with Executive Order 12564. The topics below provide more information on Air Force policy.

>
> AFI 90-508, Air Force Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program \(AFCDDRP\) establishes the Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Program objectives, policies, procedures, and implementation guidelines.
>
> The AFCDDRP is consistent with Executive Order 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace, which is designed to achieve a drug-free workplace by:
>
> * Providing assistance to employees suspected or identified  as having drug abuse problems
> * Educating and training employees
> * Identifying illicit drug use through drug testing
>
> The AFCDDRP applies to:
>
> * All Civilian Employees
> * Air Reserve Technicians in civilian status
> * Air National Guard civilian employees
> * Full time, part-time, and intermittent employees
>
> ![violations.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255779/preview)**Mandatory Administrative and Disciplinary Actions**
>
> When an employee occupying a TDP uses illicit drugs, that employee must be removed from the position.
>
> EO 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace, also requires management to propose action to remove an employee for any of the following:
>
> * Refusing to obtain counseling or treatment
> * Continued illicit drug use after first offense
> * Altering or attempting to alter, substituting or attempting to substitute your own specimen, or that of another employee
> * Failure of the mandated and/or agreed upon medically approved treatment program
>
> ![testing.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255777/preview)**Testing Designated Positions \(TDP\)**
>
> TDPs are characterized by their critical safety or security responsibilities and are subject to “RANDOM TESTING” for as long as this position is held.
>
> * These positions have a direct and immediate impact on public health and safety, the protection of life and property, law enforcement, or U.S. national security
> * TDPs require the highest degree of trust and confidence
> * TDPs are identified in the civilian job announcements and will also be reflected in an individual’s core document
> * Employees occupying a TDP are required to “SIGN” a statement of understanding acknowledging the position they hold is subject to random testing!
> * TDPs will be randomly selected and required to provide a urine sample as agreed upon in their signed letter of acknowledgement
>
> For employees in non-TDP positions, there are other types of testing. For example, if a negligent incident occurs; or if an employee’s poor performance/behavior warrants, drug testing could be imposed on an employee.

### Drug Misuse and Abuse
