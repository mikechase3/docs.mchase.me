# Day 010: Unity

## Legacy Troubleshooting

I started most of the day adding stuff to yesterday's module. My job has a lot of different tasks right now because different departments are using my time. I think lots of students only have this online work to do; while I have work with the GRILL too.

I'm a bit worried that someone is going to get mad at my supervisor or I and be like _Why the heck is Mike Chase so behind?_ and I'll just be like "Because I got more important work to do." I won't say that, but I'll hint that the kids need me. And frankly, there's an argument to be made that since they're waiting for me, the more I put them off, the more productive they'll be.

Anyways, Tyler asked us for help and he had some sort-of error. I taught Brady how to use _Quick Support_, which was pretty nice because we're equals and he taught me something new. So if I need help doing something, I can pull a favor and not look like the idiot. Not that it matters - Brady is cool.

Brady connected to _Quick Support_ \(Windows + Control + Q\) and was able to help him out while I researched the errors. I told Brady that it looks like he's missing packages - and he was missing a lot of packages. I walked him to get where Brady needed to be, and we left off with Tyler installing 20GB of packages that he needed. It'll be a little while, but thankfully, he has plenty of space so we got those packages downloading.

Hopefully... we'll have what we need and when he gets those installed and reboots his computer, we'll be golden!

## Effective Communication
