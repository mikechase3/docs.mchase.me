1. Virtual leason officers. \(LNO's\). To Earnie Vascos and Chuck DeStephanie.
   1. Chuck DeStephanie. He's local, citizen airmen on active duty orders. His Civilian is with LIDOS. In the IE \(ICE?\) Field. He knows lots of things that are going on in Wright-Patterson. Dayton-specific.
   2. Col. Earnie Vasces. LNO in CNN Santino. He runs the LNO program right now, but he has done some really cool use case work with the insider's threat hub. His regular reserve job is that he's a CIO in a unit. We also have software factories one in Boston. Popping up software factories all over the place. He has more of an airforce network for cybersecurity. CIO in an airforce detachment.
2. NASC is up in Dayton. National Intelligence stuff. They have IT/Computer Science people in. They have to clear me. If they want an intern, they have to do it really early in the school year. Have to be cleared before Thanksgiving.

   2. Insider threats too.
