>
> 33 00:07:30.030 --&gt; 00:07:33.510 It or coffee or, you know, cookie or something.
>
> 34 00:07:36.660 --&gt; 00:07:39.450 Monica go for a jog in place.
>
> 35 00:08:37.440 --&gt; 00:08:39.510 Okay, he's trying
>
> 36 00:10:36.360 --&gt; 00:10:48.570 So while we wait for Dan, I was just told that I'm presenting at this meeting, can, can someone tell me what it, what it is and about it. Can I ask that question while we wait
>
> 37 00:10:49.650 --&gt; 00:10:59.130 Yes, absolutely. How about if we start with you. You tell us about yourself and then I'll tell you what we're doing okay I'm Nikki and I run the legacy
>
> 38 00:10:59.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.140 Right, Pat. And so I'm going to talk and I think we have Emily on to who's going to talk a little bit about her legacy experience today and just the transition from working legacy program to government
>
> 39 00:11:15.270 --&gt; 00:11:23.070 Michael Chase: Okay, so give us a little bit of background degree and, you know, highly trained up with the AFL and and working with legacy program.
>
> 40 00:11:23.670 --&gt; 00:11:30.960 Michael Chase: Okay, so I actually started working on base when I was in high school. And then I went to college to become a teacher.
>
> 41 00:11:31.560 --&gt; 00:11:41.010 Michael Chase: And I have an early childhood education degree. And when I graduated office that I used to work for asked me if I wanted to come back for a job and I did. And so
>
> 42 00:11:41.670 --&gt; 00:11:48.420 Michael Chase: I worked a few different jobs and met heard about the education outreach office at right Pat and met Dan and kind of
>
> 43 00:11:49.380 --&gt; 00:12:03.270 Michael Chase: Said, hey, if you ever know of anything I have education degree. I'm really interested in working in that area. And so I think I pestered him enough that I eventually was able to start working in that right pat education outreach.
>
> 44 00:12:05.040 --&gt; 00:12:17.010 That's pretty cool. So the, the audience that you have here and I'm surprised that band didn't tell you anything. So he told me a little that this these are piece of students, but I figured I could fill some time if I needed to to
>
> 45 00:12:18.090 --&gt; 00:12:20.910 Yep, so they are the premier college intern program.
>
> 46 00:12:22.140 --&gt; 00:12:33.990 Selects so they come in and then under normal circumstances, they would be doing a 12 week internship at they're selecting facility hands on their engineers to be scientists and engineers to be
>
> 47 00:12:35.100 --&gt; 00:12:43.110 But under the circumstances of covert 19 we had to. We wanted to keep our word to them. So we've done this all virtual so we are in week four
>
> 48 00:12:44.700 --&gt; 00:12:56.100 Advantage of doing it this way is that they get to hear a lot and learn a lot that they would not have if they were working at their centers at their laptop. They're selecting facility.
>
> 49 00:12:56.610 --&gt; 00:13:01.290 This advantage is that they're not blowing smelling feeling stuff like they wouldn't they were there.
>
> 50 00:13:02.250 --&gt; 00:13:11.100 So what I wanted to do what I've tried what we have tried to do myself leader and and the team Chandra is to try to expose them.
>
> 51 00:13:11.730 --&gt; 00:13:21.840 To the many different things that the Air Force has to offer them as they began a Air Force career, a huge percentage of them. This a little over 200 of them align
>
> 52 00:13:23.280 --&gt; 00:13:37.800 Will graduate in the summer of 2021 and convert over to the POS acquire program, you know, comes with we come through all the benefits master's program. The second year automatic promotions every year, you know, seven 911 and 12
>
> 53 00:13:38.460 --&gt; 00:13:43.410 So there's a lot of benefits. But like any college students, which I'm sure you were at one time.
>
> 54 00:13:43.890 --&gt; 00:13:52.800 There's always the, the, the, the question in the back of the mind, you know, government, industry, you know, and all those little aspects.
>
> 55 00:13:53.430 --&gt; 00:14:12.270 Why I had asked Dan to talk about f4 stem and the folks that work with him is because I feel that, you know, at for STEM okay to 12 outreach program. It's really big all the way up to our Miss Baldwin, who is a sack aqr
>
> 56 00:14:13.590 --&gt; 00:14:18.780 And and I failed, like the students, you know, as you probably know already.
>
> 57 00:14:20.340 --&gt; 00:14:32.310 A you know your resume is good, but we're looking for that rounded well person, meaning that you know you've done so many different things and by their by them learning about STEM.
>
> 58 00:14:32.940 --&gt; 00:14:38.310 It gives them an idea of what we as an Air Force doing to create awareness at a young age. I mean,
>
> 59 00:14:38.730 --&gt; 00:14:45.240 I'm going to pick chase here because chases always on the chat, you know, Chase just didn't wake up the other day and say, You know, I'm going to go be an engineer.
>
> 60 00:14:45.720 --&gt; 00:14:55.350 I'm sure that chase you know at a young age realized that he was good at some things and decided that he wanted to try to pursue. I see, you know, got older and got into
>
> 61 00:14:55.890 --&gt; 00:15:05.190 middle school, high school to college that engineering was was was where he wanted to be. So I think this presentation will will will show
>
> 62 00:15:06.180 --&gt; 00:15:20.010 Our future SMEs that the force you know embraces everything at such a young age to help them grow and how we partner with a lot of the schools at the elementary, middle school level to create awareness of stem
>
> 63 00:15:24.630 --&gt; 00:15:30.810 Know, I mean, and I've been taught dance taxi me telling me, he's trying online. So what he was he was
>
> 64 00:15:32.610 --&gt; 00:15:41.040 Michael Chase: Suggested by amo now. So let me talk a little bit to give you an introduction, Nikki, and I could go back now the call now for
>
> 65 00:15:42.840 --&gt; 00:15:50.850 Everyone I'm Bryan Stevenson. I work a lot with angels and Nicole, as well as employees are so work with me.
>
> 66 00:15:58.440 --&gt; 00:16:07.500 Michael Chase: So what the whole purposes will Air Force gym, which is often the top has to go to the kindergarten to 12th grade. And then a little bit beyond that.
>
> 67 00:16:07.950 --&gt; 00:16:22.530 Michael Chase: So the goal is to increase awareness to children's thing also let them know more about air force that their whole life, your career in the military civilian to get them engaged and thing also trained him in those areas that we want them to go in your teacher
>
> 68 00:16:23.640 --&gt; 00:16:32.490 So what we have done. And this is where I'm Nikki comes in. We're gonna let the program before we got getting the Air Force game and then we'll talk more about this is
>
> 69 00:16:33.030 --&gt; 00:16:47.040 They do joint tenancy Magnuson Polish nail painting is the science, engineering festival, as well as other things where they're reaching out to students, on behalf of the Air Force and conferencing em and getting them engaged and saying this is what the opportunity, you can do
>
> 70 00:16:48.120 --&gt; 00:16:51.270 And we give them access as the psyches and airfare we give them
>
> 71 00:16:52.740 --&gt; 00:17:02.610 Awards, as well as money for projects that you present the science fairs, I can we talk to him also about careers. So while we were doing all this me against it and let's
>
> 72 00:17:03.120 --&gt; 00:17:10.740 Bridge bridge that gap. Let's come up your program thing is, is we're legacy came up and say we're going to look at those kids early on.
>
> 73 00:17:11.310 --&gt; 00:17:26.790 And give opportunities for students who are don't typically have opportunity to be part of the company militaries as a civilian arm and giving an opportunity again Gorgon engineers that remeeting the golden light hypersonic data analytics autonomy machine learning.
>
> 74 00:17:27.960 --&gt; 00:17:42.330 Michael Chase: Musicians stereo despite that, yeah, gay, we can already start tapping into them and having thinking outside the box and welcoming those areas so that way it'll be a better airports think Air Force game is trying to make sure we have the skin lyric still blurry.
>
> 75 00:17:43.380 --&gt; 00:17:53.250 More force coming in. So with that, Mickey passed on you while still getting on the call with Mr. Black Earth and stuff. So I will be back and forth.
>
> 76 00:17:55.200 --&gt; 00:17:55.650 Yeah.
>
> 77 00:17:56.940 --&gt; 00:18:13.620 So I can, I can talk to just is Brian was saying, and they kind of and Daniel show a chart that shows like a pipeline of us trying to pull out some of those kids. I don't know how many of you guys maybe WERE INVOLVED IN FIRST LEGO League or the meds or
>
> 78 00:18:15.330 --&gt; 00:18:23.190 First Robotics. All of those things. So, some of those are government sponsored programs. And yeah, I've seen I fellow FTC definitely those
>
> 79 00:18:23.550 --&gt; 00:18:30.720 So and dean's office. He has people who work on some of those first programs so I'm
>
> 80 00:18:31.350 --&gt; 00:18:36.090 The government some sometimes I don't want to say sponsor he'll know the better word. He is but
>
> 81 00:18:36.510 --&gt; 00:18:50.520 He has people who will work with those and run those for the state of Ohio and I think some of Pennsylvania. And so one of the questions that Brian was talking about is like Ben was so we're getting these kids interested in everything, then why so that's why legacy came in and
>
> 82 00:18:51.600 --&gt; 00:18:57.360 Michael Chase: They kind of develop this and then brought me over. So we start at age 11 those
>
> 83 00:18:58.230 --&gt; 00:19:07.020 Michael Chase: Students can attend camps or one week and it goes the camps are for age 11 page 50. And the reason we do, we used to do grades.
>
> 84 00:19:07.830 --&gt; 00:19:17.130 Michael Chase: We started at sixth grade 10th grade. And then we were like, oh no, and you're in 10th grade, you might only be 15 so we kind of had those students work and
>
> 85 00:19:17.880 --&gt; 00:19:19.530 Michael Chase: bloods on base or anything like that.
>
> 86 00:19:20.400 --&gt; 00:19:32.700 Michael Chase: So, and then we started saying let's do ages. So age 11 1213 1415 or one week camps and their hands on stem camps in the summer. And one of the things we like to do is bring back some of the students
>
> 87 00:19:33.120 --&gt; 00:19:39.570 Michael Chase: Who were interns to go and help some of those projects or to tell about their experience and the internship.
>
> 88 00:19:40.080 --&gt; 00:19:48.480 Michael Chase: From there they can go on to the internship. It's nothing is guaranteed. So one week camps in the summer and they reapply the next the next year.
>
> 89 00:19:49.200 --&gt; 00:20:01.260 Michael Chase: And then they can apply for an internship when they turn 16 so at 16 then they'll do internships for six to eight weeks over the summer. So we say bacon or 242 320 hours.
>
> 90 00:20:02.160 --&gt; 00:20:09.000 Michael Chase: And those internships are probably very similar to what you guys are doing, especially this summer because there were all virtual to
>
> 91 00:20:09.600 --&gt; 00:20:18.060 Michael Chase: Um, so they will work in the labs and they will have their own research projects that they're running and things like that. So, I mean,
>
> 92 00:20:18.600 --&gt; 00:20:32.700 Michael Chase: I like to tell the legacy students if you do a job that you hate for one summer. That's awesome. Like you got paid to learn that you do not want to go to school for four years and
>
> 93 00:20:33.210 --&gt; 00:20:43.350 Michael Chase: Do and do what you thought you might want to do. So I, I like to see it as a as a positive that maybe wasn't the best three month experience of your life or two months experience but
>
> 94 00:20:43.830 --&gt; 00:20:52.260 Michael Chase: You were able to learn what you didn't want to go to school for because I think. So often people think they won't know what they want to do, but maybe when they get into it.
>
> 95 00:20:52.770 --&gt; 00:20:59.400 Michael Chase: Might be too late or I've gone, I've gone down too far. So during that summer, they'll have those opportunities.
>
> 96 00:20:59.820 --&gt; 00:21:08.490 Michael Chase: And then will we also do what we call professional refinements or like lunch and learns and we had people come out professionals come out and talk about their experience and
>
> 97 00:21:09.030 --&gt; 00:21:21.570 Michael Chase: Or we did one this summer, a CT CT prep for those students that are still in high school. We did basketball because I think we all know how complicated that form can be we had someone Ed was talking about.
>
> 98 00:21:23.070 --&gt; 00:21:30.420 The benefits of working for government versus industry. Now I've only ever worked for the government. So I can't really speak to that, but I'm
>
> 99 00:21:31.290 --&gt; 00:21:40.050 Rich dork, who is the other legacy program manager. He's worked in industry and government. So he's, he was able to talk about the perspective of that.
>
> 100 00:21:40.410 --&gt; 00:21:44.670 And talk about some of the benefits and when I say, but if it's I don't just mean
>
> 101 00:21:45.240 --&gt; 00:21:57.660 Health benefits or anything like that. But there are a lot of benefits for for working and Brian helped us put together a list for that too. So I'm Ed, I definitely be willing to share that is this dance on if the
>
> 102 00:21:59.160 --&gt; 00:22:05.820 If he's if it's like they're moving. No, sorry, that was me. I was searching the participant list to see
>
> 103 00:22:09.000 --&gt; 00:22:09.540 If he
>
> 104 00:22:10.650 --&gt; 00:22:12.180 He text me something I'm
>
> 105 00:22:14.790 --&gt; 00:22:21.930 I'm Nikki your good work. Yeah, we're going to do this little unconventional my computer decided to do a hard restart.
>
> 106 00:22:23.730 --&gt; 00:22:25.290 And so I've got the slide right now.
>
> 107 00:22:26.670 --&gt; 00:22:32.910 And add I heard that comment I'm in charge of the Air Force K 12 stem. I couldn't agree with you more.
>
> 108 00:22:39.030 --&gt; 00:22:40.470 So did you
>
> 109 00:22:41.760 --&gt; 00:22:42.390 Did it just go
>
> 110 00:22:43.590 --&gt; 00:22:44.340 I didn't hit the wrong.

> 111 00:22:53.460 --&gt; 00:23:13.260 Michael Chase: Can you guys hear me yeah we got to go ahead. Okay. Okay, good. I'm sorry. I took my computer and put it on the docking station over the weekend so the the tea and technology for STEM is not working on my, on my side. But, so I apologize for the for the late start, Nikki did a great job of
>
> 112 00:23:14.430 --&gt; 00:23:20.280 Really kind of hitting the legacy program and Brian did a good job of kind of warm to the nuts and bolts.
>
> 113 00:23:23.040 --&gt; 00:23:29.280 So I'm just going to go ahead and go over the phone with you and kind of get the slide. So if you guys have any questions, holler.
>
> 114 00:23:31.140 --&gt; 00:23:32.130 My name is Dan Andrews.
>
> 115 00:23:33.150 --&gt; 00:23:49.590 I'm the acting Air Force K 12 stem lead currently to Vicki stone KING RETIRED October I am also the right path educational outreach office division chief so I oversee and manage the right path program here.
>
> 116 00:23:51.030 --&gt; 00:23:55.770 For the Air Force K 12 stem. Let's go with the next slide here.
>
> 117 00:23:57.150 --&gt; 00:24:03.180 bottom line up front. We are guided by the bright horizons document, which is the
>
> 118 00:24:04.350 --&gt; 00:24:08.250 Which is the Air Force workforce strategy we support goal for
>
> 119 00:24:09.630 --&gt; 00:24:19.860 As you can see, our job here is to inspire cultivate promote and enhance we want to get kids. We want to get kids excited about STEM. We want to get kids.
>
> 120 00:24:21.240 --&gt; 00:24:27.210 You know, it seems not scary. That's, that's what we want to enhance with some of these students were working with students.
>
> 121 00:24:28.470 --&gt; 00:24:42.300 That we have the bottom five to bottom seven school districts in Ohio here, and I'm sure at other basis, they have the school districts that are struggling. We want to show these kids that it's not hard.
>
> 122 00:24:43.560 --&gt; 00:24:49.380 When I was in high school, I went to a rural school district and two weeks into my freshman year I was told that
>
> 123 00:24:50.640 --&gt; 00:25:02.070 The principal told my parents that you know he's just not college material needs to go go go into agriculture. Now there's nothing wrong with agriculture because that's my family's background but
>
> 124 00:25:03.120 --&gt; 00:25:15.300 basically telling me I shouldn't go to college. And so that is that that was kind of a kind of a little upset and so I strived to go to college and get that four year degree.
>
> 125 00:25:16.170 --&gt; 00:25:23.280 Then I moved on to the my master's degree and provided my principal with copies of those kind of giving them showing him that, you know,
>
> 126 00:25:24.270 --&gt; 00:25:39.180 He was wrong. And so a lot of these kids that I come across always say, Well, you know, engineering to order my guidance counselor told me it's too hard and you know and that's that's not what we're wanting to get these kids were wanting to show everyone can can make that there
>
> 127 00:25:42.000 --&gt; 00:25:58.470 Right now with the coven situation, everything is on the table as far as trying to get folks interested students, parents, educators student influencers I know that I'm about zoomed out about WebEx out
>
> 128 00:25:59.850 --&gt; 00:26:01.860 Michael Chase: Etc out but
>
> 129 00:26:03.180 --&gt; 00:26:15.540 We have to keep pushing through and pushing through because if we just stopped trying to provide resources to parents and teachers and students. We're going to lose that edge. We're going to lose that excitement. Next slide.
>
> 130 00:26:17.820 --&gt; 00:26:27.780 The Air Force K 12 STEM program is made up of a various amount of different on different on ramps different ways to get connected
>
> 131 00:26:28.650 --&gt; 00:26:42.810 Each of the base installations, but we'll have a couple of slides will have them listed, but each of the basis. There should be some type of or some flavor of K 12 stem outreach, whether it's an installation.
>
> 132 00:26:43.950 --&gt; 00:26:44.490 Office.
>
> 133 00:26:45.720 --&gt; 00:26:47.940 That I'll go with a go over with you guys later.
>
> 134 00:26:49.020 --&gt; 00:26:57.510 Or my current one that right path or there are places where there's a belly button that can get out to the community. I know there's some basis that have
>
> 135 00:26:59.580 --&gt; 00:27:12.180 Stem outreach offices slaps liaison officers that can be able to get that get you guys connected into the community into STEM programs to volunteer and to give back into kind of complete that cycle.
>
> 136 00:27:13.680 --&gt; 00:27:22.230 So there are those ways of being involved. Then there's also some of the national programs that we have Brian mentioned junior science and humanities symposium.
>
> 137 00:27:23.100 --&gt; 00:27:32.310 International Science and Engineering fair program. These are great programs to get involved with regionally and you can earn your way through.
>
> 138 00:27:33.000 --&gt; 00:27:46.350 To compete at the at the national competitions. These are all for high school students, but it's a good way to go back and judge. We're always looking for bicep judges so
>
> 139 00:27:48.420 --&gt; 00:28:07.230 I know it's in May, but we're always looking so you know put that in your in your hat when you become a government full time government civilian during the spring months we'll definitely be able to use your help and assistance cyber Patriot stellar explore, we also
>
> 140 00:28:08.310 --&gt; 00:28:20.130 Have a various amount of star based programs. We also support the first programs all for programs from, you know, THE FIRST LEGO League junior FIRST LEGO League first tech PR for robotics.
>
> 141 00:28:21.060 --&gt; 00:28:31.290 We also partner and support Civil Air Patrol and the Air Force junior razzi. So those are some of the ways you can get involved with the K 12 STEM programs.
>
> 142 00:28:33.120 --&gt; 00:28:38.310 And when you see the map. If you are located at one of those bases and you want to volunteer.
>
> 143 00:28:39.000 --&gt; 00:28:54.720 Please get ahold of me please email me, I will. I would love to get you in touch with the the base K 12 stem lead there. Yeah, I know it's a core on virtual but some of them are looking for guest speakers so you can, you know, speak into a classroom virtually
>
> 144 00:28:56.070 --&gt; 00:28:59.610 You know, Judge science fairs, whatever that the basis doing now.
>
> 145 00:29:00.780 --&gt; 00:29:04.470 They're going to probably try to flip it virtual so you can get into the classrooms.
>
> 146 00:29:06.150 --&gt; 00:29:06.810 Next slide please.
>
> 147 00:29:08.910 --&gt; 00:29:10.230 These are some of the goals and objectives.
>
> 148 00:29:11.340 --&gt; 00:29:22.290 I'm not going to go, word for word in for it. But this just shows that you know out of the workforce development plan for the Air Force stem strategy we do support Goal five
>
> 149 00:29:23.730 --&gt; 00:29:32.610 You know, we try to leverage industry schools and other government agencies to to get these kids interested in STEM and aviation aerospace and all that fun stuff.
>
> 150 00:29:33.810 --&gt; 00:29:34.290 Next slide.
>
> 151 00:29:35.910 --&gt; 00:29:56.310 So here are kind of the, the metrics, so to speak. Last year alone. The 29 basis that provided metrics impacted over 550,000 students 23,000 teachers 3000 plus activities and events and over 130,000 volunteer hours amen to that to the program.
>
> 152 00:29:58.680 --&gt; 00:30:10.290 You know, and I'm not making any comparisons, by any means, but I was doing my research and the army and navy together and their stand their stem from kato I believe undergrad.
>
> 153 00:30:11.370 --&gt; 00:30:14.010 Combined with 64,000 students
>
> 154 00:30:15.960 --&gt; 00:30:27.270 Again, that's kind of a wagon, so to speak, but the Air Force, you know, impact 550,000 K 12 STEM students that that's very impressive.
>
> 155 00:30:27.990 --&gt; 00:30:41.220 Those, those impacts could be a one and done. It could be a damn it could be a mentorship through programs like first your cyber patriot. So there's a there's a various amounts of ways that the
>
> 156 00:30:42.330 --&gt; 00:30:43.860 Folks in the Air Force can volunteer.
>
> 157 00:30:45.060 --&gt; 00:30:50.040 To support the next slide will show you all the primary locations that we have
>
> 158 00:30:51.180 --&gt; 00:30:55.170 These are the these are the main locations that we have Air Force K 12 stem
>
> 159 00:30:56.190 --&gt; 00:31:04.710 Coordinators asked if you are on the location that's not listed here let me know and I can try to find the someone who is
>
> 160 00:31:05.880 --&gt; 00:31:13.530 The K 12 stem lead or the student liaison officer and they've got a pretty good good handle on things. So we are currently located at these
>
> 161 00:31:14.910 --&gt; 00:31:15.930 Five places.
>
> 162 00:31:18.060 --&gt; 00:31:30.690 Next slide. There's some contact information. We have a centralized website that we can show you know that all those bases and you can click on More information for instance right pat you click on the right path map.
>
> 163 00:31:32.550 --&gt; 00:31:35.400 And it'll send us to send us to they'll send you to our website.
>
> 164 00:31:36.630 --&gt; 00:31:44.610 It does that for all the various locations that have that type of support some just have a regular website just to contact them.
>
> 165 00:31:46.950 --&gt; 00:31:48.210 But otherwise, others have
>
> 166 00:31:50.400 --&gt; 00:31:54.720 Specific websites to support you guys have any questions for now.
>
> 167 00:31:57.810 --&gt; 00:31:59.130 Awesome. Alright.
>
> 168 00:32:00.270 --&gt; 00:32:07.620 There's a question out there that talks about, you know, volunteering during like hours, three hours.
>
> 169 00:32:09.030 --&gt; 00:32:11.250 Can't. Can you talk about that.
>
> 170 00:32:12.360 --&gt; 00:32:19.050 volunteering for duty hours. You know what yeah what while you're at work, you know, you're going to employ you're ready and volunteer in your in your duty to go do that.
>
> 171 00:32:20.940 --&gt; 00:32:43.200 Yeah, yeah. So, so right now the and we're working through this with with Saturday to the day if I said it earlier. Last year, said that you could volunteer up to four hours of your day for stimulated activities that has since been removed from the language for for the AFL
>
> 172 00:32:44.820 --&gt; 00:32:57.000 CIO, what we tell our folks here right Pat is talk to your supervisor, talk to your supervisor and find out what their thoughts are, what they're feeling on volunteering for
>
> 173 00:32:59.100 --&gt; 00:33:06.570 Things like that K 12 stem during the hours, you'll see a lot of a lot of supervisors will allow it as long as it doesn't get out of control.
>
> 174 00:33:07.950 --&gt; 00:33:18.090 So it's kind of a mixed bag. We're working with Mr. Aaron freshwater at SAP to see where who I that language was removed from the API.
>
> 175 00:33:20.160 --&gt; 00:33:30.900 For volunteering. So, but, but my suggestion would be to talk to your immediate supervisor, find out what the permissions are what the boundaries are and then be able to go from there.
>
> 176 00:33:36.900 --&gt; 00:33:37.980 All right, any other questions.
>
> 177 00:33:41.100 --&gt; 00:33:41.550 All right.
>
> 178 00:33:42.600 --&gt; 00:33:45.600 Next slide for the right path educational outreach office.
>
> 179 00:33:46.650 --&gt; 00:33:56.160 Next slide. Our mission here is to attract inspire develop student winners get these kids excited get these kids that don't normally have those opportunities.
>
> 180 00:33:57.900 --&gt; 00:34:15.030 An idea what it's like to be behind the fence of Wright Patterson Air Force Base, or be able to interact with a, an engineer subject matter expert someone that can can spark that young, young, young, young mind.
>
> 181 00:34:16.230 --&gt; 00:34:24.810 To further explore engineering we we are trying to develop the Nate is developed a future workforce of tomorrow.
>
> 182 00:34:25.530 --&gt; 00:34:35.880 And I know that sounds cheesy and that sounds corny and throughout the years, and I've been doing this since 2008 it sounds corny, but the further you get the further you go
>
> 183 00:34:36.600 --&gt; 00:34:43.710 You start to realize that, wow, with everything going, you know, artificial intelligence jobs that are
>
> 184 00:34:44.370 --&gt; 00:34:52.740 Are going to happen that these jobs that are going to come out and you know 2030 and 2025 even though they haven't even been developed. They haven't even been created yet.
>
> 185 00:34:53.220 --&gt; 00:35:05.100 And our youth are going to take these jobs. You guys are the future. And you know what, who's going to come behind you, guys. That's what we're. That's what we're worried about right now. Next slide.
>
> 186 00:35:06.240 --&gt; 00:35:15.570 You can see all the Wright Patterson Air Force Base outreach programs I manage 18 programs for the Air Force or for the right path educational outreach office.
>
> 187 00:35:17.160 --&gt; 00:35:26.790 We have programs from the first programs competitions that we run with the Affiliate Partner for Ohio for the entire State of Ohio, we have
>
> 188 00:35:28.140 --&gt; 00:35:34.260 Where we provide tutors mentors classroom speaker science or judges to the local classrooms to the local teachers.
>
> 189 00:35:36.480 --&gt; 00:35:43.500 Before it was in person, hands on. Now we're looking at a virtual platform where folks want to
>
> 190 00:35:44.880 --&gt; 00:35:49.380 Teachers are requesting us to come in and judge your science fairs, how's that going to look
>
> 191 00:35:50.640 --&gt; 00:35:52.080 We've had to do a complete one at
>
> 192 00:35:53.130 --&gt; 00:35:58.380 Some schools here in Ohio are going to be able to allow external visitors, then, some are not.
>
> 193 00:35:59.400 --&gt; 00:36:12.660 Some one no visitors no field trips nothing which is fine, but what we'll do is we will have a virtual of etc station in our office, so to speak, as to where our volunteers can come to our office and
>
> 194 00:36:13.740 --&gt; 00:36:20.310 Zoom into the classrooms. So we're trying to do. We're trying to find different ways to get in and impact the students
>
> 195 00:36:22.290 --&gt; 00:36:35.190 We have a star based program job shadow day Wizards of right that's been kind of one of our, our, our platform programs here since we've all gone. Virtual they've done a lot of hands on videos.
>
> 196 00:36:36.330 --&gt; 00:36:46.920 Michael Chase: For the teachers for students for parents very quick two and a half, three, five minute videos of experiments that can be done within the house and with the household items.
>
> 197 00:36:48.210 --&gt; 00:36:49.770 We're always looking for ideas.
>
> 198 00:36:50.850 --&gt; 00:36:58.950 Michael Chase: So if you're at Wright Patterson and you want to volunteer, you have some ideas or if you're anywhere, please let us know. We're always willing to provide these
>
> 199 00:36:59.790 --&gt; 00:37:09.300 Michael Chase: Resources and materials through our website and they're free. Everything we offer is 100% free and we want to make sure that the
>
> 200 00:37:10.440 --&gt; 00:37:16.500 Michael Chase: Teachers, the parents and the students can be able to use utilize the efforts.
>
> 201 00:37:18.360 --&gt; 00:37:21.210 You'll see I stuff on there. Read Across America.
>
> 202 00:37:22.410 --&gt; 00:37:24.600 So we have a slew of programs that that
>
> 203 00:37:25.740 --&gt; 00:37:32.610 That are quite amazing. Next slide, you can see the right path education and outreach off is covered, just for first programs.
>
> 204 00:37:33.630 --&gt; 00:37:41.010 On the left hand side, you can see how many teams we support and how many events we support on the right. We are one of the largest single site and first
>
> 205 00:37:43.020 --&gt; 00:37:48.030 We're the leading meeting way are leading the way in the US for that.
>
> 206 00:37:49.140 --&gt; 00:37:49.770 Next slide.
>
> 207 00:37:50.940 --&gt; 00:38:01.530 Michael Chase: We're more involved in a number of the community event camps and engagements when I, when I first got to the office there the summers were free, there were nothing going on to the summertime.
>
> 208 00:38:02.160 --&gt; 00:38:11.220 Michael Chase: And next thing you know, parents, teachers, kids, they're wanting camps winning teacher workshops and so it's just hit the ground running. So
>
> 209 00:38:11.790 --&gt; 00:38:24.360 Michael Chase: We're involved in probably 10 to 12 summer camps through legacy star base. And first we also go out to the to the number of festivals stem festivals here in the local area.
>
> 210 00:38:26.280 --&gt; 00:38:34.440 Michael Chase: The in ca first for STEM who block which is in March. That is a big event for us and they
>
> 211 00:38:35.460 --&gt; 00:38:42.180 To celebrate those first four games they do a stem hoopla and so we're involved in that stem hoopla which
>
> 212 00:38:42.570 --&gt; 00:38:51.000 Are kids from I believe first grade through eighth grade and they mix, you know, free throw, shooting competition to stem competence or stem like
>
> 213 00:38:51.390 --&gt; 00:39:07.410 freebies, and in hands on stuff. So all of my program managers bring their bring their hands on stuff for the kids. And even for the adults have to be able to play and to be able to get excited and it's a great way for us to promote our programs to the parents and to the community.
>
> 214 00:39:08.730 --&gt; 00:39:11.040 So we've been involved with
>
> 215 00:39:12.090 --&gt; 00:39:28.530 Everything from, you know, a school stem regional festival to the Secretary of the Air Force's Marvel day we she personally requested our assistance for that. And we were at the Smithsonian shooting straw rockets in front of the rockets.
>
> 216 00:39:30.240 --&gt; 00:39:35.760 Leading up to the debut of the of Captain Marvel so
>
> 217 00:39:36.870 --&gt; 00:39:50.490 It's a great. It's a great way to get out and show what the Air Force and right that's doing the next slide, you can see all the metrics. I won't go through with you last year was 80,000 students impacted reached influence
>
> 218 00:39:51.810 --&gt; 00:39:59.730 You know 92 plus school districts and we provided $5.2 million worth of free education programs to the area and to the state.
>
> 219 00:40:01.110 --&gt; 00:40:13.590 And when Brian mentioned that we were trying to look at a way for to bridge these programs that we do and we always get. I've always received this from day one. So what
>
> 220 00:40:14.880 --&gt; 00:40:34.740 Michael Chase: You guys do all these great programs. But so what. So I got tired of it got tired of hearing it. And so, Brian and I grabbed some McDonalds came back to my building and white boarded kind of the skeleton of how we can make that connection and legacy came about.
>
> 221 00:40:35.760 --&gt; 00:40:49.020 And so bridging that gap from the middle school to the high school to college is what we were wanting to do. And so we were able to
>
> 222 00:40:50.490 --&gt; 00:41:01.620 Come up with some tamps come up with some apprenticeships internships and when we looked at the the the the the smattering of internships, you had to have
>
> 223 00:41:02.160 --&gt; 00:41:14.610 Some of the programs that we looked at, you had to have a 4.5 4.2 4.3 and we didn't have some kids that we were looking at that had 5.2 I didn't know you could go into the size, but you can
>
> 224 00:41:15.330 --&gt; 00:41:24.450 And we were kind of looking at that going, well, you know, I surely didn't have that kind of GPI I think my high school GPA was a 2.7 or 2.8 2.9
>
> 225 00:41:24.990 --&gt; 00:41:34.500 And then in college. I figured it out. We got a 3539 but I would have never had that opportunity. Some of these kids that are coming into our program.
>
> 226 00:41:35.730 --&gt; 00:41:41.670 They, they don't they don't have that they don't have the way to class with the AP courses, things like that. So,

> 227 00:41:42.720 --&gt; 00:41:46.050 What our goal is, we have a 2.5 GPA.
>
> 228 00:41:47.130 --&gt; 00:41:53.700 That we want the kids to have starting in and we want to elevate those kids. We want to be able to give those opportunities to the kids.
>
> 229 00:41:54.570 --&gt; 00:42:04.590 That need help that need that are excited about them and want to work work at it and that's where Nikki and then my 10 her team come in and they're the ones that come in and take care of that.
>
> 230 00:42:05.880 --&gt; 00:42:13.710 To be able to provide tutoring programs that we have here right pad or any other databases to be able to link the link to help to the kids.
>
> 231 00:42:15.930 --&gt; 00:42:17.670 Michael Chase: But that was also
>
> 232 00:42:18.810 --&gt; 00:42:22.890 legacies a pilot program for students for the everyday student
>
> 233 00:42:24.270 --&gt; 00:42:29.850 Michael Chase: We have a lot of students that they they help, they help their, their with their helping their parents as an income.
>
> 234 00:42:30.540 --&gt; 00:42:39.870 Michael Chase: They're helping them with their brothers and sisters, they're from, you know, school districts that don't wouldn't normally have a student working at Wright Patterson, because their GPA is not
>
> 235 00:42:40.620 --&gt; 00:42:57.450 Michael Chase: A skyrocket GPA. So being able to link into the schools and be able to give kids, an opportunity and get show them what they can do, has been absolutely rewarding, at least on my part. So I'm going to hand the mic over to Nikki.
>
> 236 00:42:59.550 --&gt; 00:43:06.270 If you want to go through and kind of you've kind of touched on some things. But if you want to go through and do a little bit more into detail, go right ahead.
>
> 237 00:43:09.150 --&gt; 00:43:11.130 They can I get it. The next slide please.
>
> 238 00:43:12.990 --&gt; 00:43:20.880 So as I introduced myself earlier. So I've been working on the legacy programs, since November 2016 so
>
> 239 00:43:21.870 --&gt; 00:43:28.980 So we all know what legacy stands for it is leadership experience growing apprenticeships committed to youth. Next slide please.
>
> 240 00:43:29.760 --&gt; 00:43:40.050 I bet if we asked the students, they won't know what that means. Okay, I talked about these, the craftsmen camp are our one week camps. Those are hands on during those we have all the materials we have
>
> 241 00:43:40.470 --&gt; 00:43:44.580 Teachers who promised him teachers who come out and teach those to the students.
>
> 242 00:43:45.510 --&gt; 00:44:02.430 We have an end of the week open house where students can invite their parents or whoever to come out and be able to see everything they worked on that week. And as I mentioned to we like to bring I saw and I made a comment like one time and I came back and talked about her experience.
>
> 243 00:44:03.690 --&gt; 00:44:10.290 Being an intern and then talk to the students who had the opportunity to follow a year to be an intern.
>
> 244 00:44:12.270 --&gt; 00:44:22.950 Michael Chase: So if it, if it works out that you get invited to be a junior apprentice so craftsmen. Can you we invite them back. They have to reapply you cheer and then
>
> 245 00:44:23.760 --&gt; 00:44:33.540 Michael Chase: If someone is interested in a minute, maybe it's just not a good fit for them, then they won't get invited back and the same with a junior righteous. We only want students who really want to be there.
>
> 246 00:44:34.080 --&gt; 00:44:49.740 Michael Chase: Um, so we are one of the biggest struggles that we have is to find mentors or students. So we really want top notch students out there. So if a mentor see someone they're like, oh, I want a student like that and it will be easier for us if I'm, if
>
> 247 00:44:51.180 --&gt; 00:44:56.040 I'm from the junior apprentice once they get in college, we call them apprentices, very similar.
>
> 248 00:44:57.360 --&gt; 00:45:15.060 Michael Chase: To the junior apprentice stage. The only real differences we are really looking to place those in civilian positions as apprentices so Anya transferred to piece it Emily is on the line, she transferred to smart. We have some pathway students and
>
> 249 00:45:16.170 --&gt; 00:45:25.260 I'll touch on our target candidates as Dan said one of our one of our big things to his GPA, we're not looking for like 4.0 5.0 students, we are
>
> 250 00:45:25.650 --&gt; 00:45:36.810 Not looking GPA isn't the biggest concern to us. We're looking for students who maybe aren't getting opportunities students who are military dependents students who
>
> 251 00:45:38.160 --&gt; 00:45:49.470 Are balancing a lot of things. So there are some students who really are involved in a lot of sports and all of those things. And you're just going to become a more well rounded employee when you're balancing all the
>
> 252 00:45:50.580 --&gt; 00:45:51.510 Next chart please.
>
> 253 00:45:57.510 --&gt; 00:46:20.220 Michael Chase: So here is just another look at our pipeline and we do it as a pyramid, because we at the cross band camp, that's much, much bigger group. So we have at right path. About six about 80 students this year in our camp. So then junior Prentice. I think we have about
>
> 254 00:46:21.480 --&gt; 00:46:31.680 40 of those and apprentices. We have about 17 so we really are fine tuning that as we go along. So we have some junior apprentices who
>
> 255 00:46:32.250 --&gt; 00:46:40.710 Discover that this isn't, this isn't the field. I thought it is I'm going to go study something else or we have some who just want to look at other opportunities.
>
> 256 00:46:41.340 --&gt; 00:46:52.170 And so as we go along. It just now we're just narrowing down, who thinks they might want to end up working in STEM for the government. Next chart please.
>
> 257 00:46:57.450 --&gt; 00:47:06.330 Okay. So on this chart. We're just talking about all of those things I've talked about already. So we're building that interested. How, how poor we're casting that net really wide.
>
> 258 00:47:06.690 --&gt; 00:47:14.100 And as we go through. We're giving them the opportunity to work in those career fields. They like to get to talk about
>
> 259 00:47:15.120 --&gt; 00:47:33.870 What they did through presentations and things like that. And each year day we have final presentations for all the interns, where we have them share with each other what they do and we get to invite people from a referral or from other places across the airport. Next chart please.
>
> 260 00:47:40.380 --&gt; 00:47:46.800 Michael Chase: Okay, these are our demographic. So one of the things that I read one said that if a
>
> 261 00:47:47.580 --&gt; 00:47:54.450 Michael Chase: If a girl isn't interested in STEM. By the time she's in I think it's six or seventh grade, she's not going to be interested in it.
>
> 262 00:47:55.050 --&gt; 00:48:05.940 Michael Chase: So that's one of the reasons you know it's important to start early with with students and why we have our camps to bring those out. So this is just showing our female to male ratio and
>
> 263 00:48:06.570 --&gt; 00:48:13.440 Michael Chase: I think it's I think it's really great. And I know that there are a lot of programs.
>
> 264 00:48:14.340 --&gt; 00:48:22.320 Michael Chase: That maybe this isn't a priority for them. But this is a priority for us to make sure activities are interesting in the camps.
>
> 265 00:48:22.860 --&gt; 00:48:33.780 Michael Chase: Girls boys, whoever to make sure everyone is interested in wants to stay long. But we have a 72% return rate from last summer. So we're also really proud of that because
>
> 266 00:48:35.550 --&gt; 00:48:38.880 The return rate for some for some programs is not
>
> 267 00:48:39.960 --&gt; 00:48:49.440 Is not great. And one of the things that we think we do that keeps people coming back is if someone tells us. I know I mentioned earlier, if someone doesn't like something
>
> 268 00:48:49.860 --&gt; 00:49:06.000 That's okay, we'll try to work with them to find them a better fit the next summer. I think one of the biggest things is the attitude of how you approach, all that. And so we really work through that with the legacy students to be able to get them place where they where they might
>
> 269 00:49:07.050 --&gt; 00:49:07.740 Enjoy it more
>
> 270 00:49:09.060 --&gt; 00:49:10.710 Michael Chase: Um. Next chart please.
>
> 271 00:49:14.430 --&gt; 00:49:22.920 These are our numbers from the past few years, you can see that we've really grown since we started into 720 17 and that's because
>
> 272 00:49:23.130 --&gt; 00:49:30.270 We've also expanded to other basis. So I saw there are some Hill Air Force Base students out there. We have a legacy program there. We have a legacy program.
>
> 273 00:49:30.780 --&gt; 00:49:39.540 At Eglin Air Force Base, and we have a legacy airport program at the United States Air Force Academy. So there they had the camps in internships, as well.
>
> 274 00:49:40.350 --&gt; 00:49:44.460 So I know I saw some messages that people who want to get involved. Those were things that I
>
> 275 00:49:45.300 --&gt; 00:49:59.760 Would suggest like maybe next summer. If you're working that you could go out and talk about, you know, your experience and just their college or your experience through the internship or we even have scientists and engineers come out and run
>
> 276 00:50:01.050 --&gt; 00:50:01.380 And
>
> 277 00:50:03.570 --&gt; 00:50:14.550 Michael Chase: Some of the activities for the students. Some of our big successes are shown down there. We've had some students who have joined the Army, the Navy. We have a student this year, who actually, his last days tomorrow when he's going to join.
>
> 278 00:50:15.030 --&gt; 00:50:24.930 Michael Chase: The Coast Guard. We have one student who is he left the program because he's training to join the Olympics. And then we have to smart scholars and Emily is on here.
>
> 279 00:50:25.350 --&gt; 00:50:29.280 Michael Chase: And I'm going to ask her in a little bit to kind of talk about her experience. And then we have
>
> 280 00:50:30.060 --&gt; 00:50:34.380 Michael Chase: Three pathway, a pathway students and a piece of in and is on here and we're going to ask her as well.
>
> 281 00:50:35.100 --&gt; 00:50:48.420 Michael Chase: As the student. He was published is actually one of our smart students whose name is Scott and Scott thought publish as a high school student and a scientific journal. So that is a huge accomplishment for him. And we really
>
> 282 00:50:49.500 --&gt; 00:50:58.410 Mean, he's great. And he deserved that. But his mentor really set him up for that. So, you know, as we go through. You'll learn that your mentors.
>
> 283 00:50:59.430 --&gt; 00:51:01.230 Will help you as you go along.
>
> 284 00:51:02.280 --&gt; 00:51:03.780 Next Sharpies
>
> 285 00:51:06.390 --&gt; 00:51:14.400 Michael Chase: This show some of the same information as the chair before and just shows that we're moving students along throughout the pipeline and
>
> 286 00:51:16.530 --&gt; 00:51:23.970 You'll see the funnel on the side that as I talked about to earlier is just really showing that we're trying
>
> 287 00:51:26.430 --&gt; 00:51:33.480 A lot of you mentioned survey. So we're trying to reach out to some of those students who were interested and
>
> 288 00:51:35.160 --&gt; 00:51:37.260 They may have not had the opportunity
>
> 289 00:51:38.670 --&gt; 00:51:44.040 Before before legacy or before another program like to be able to come back.
>
> 290 00:51:45.480 --&gt; 00:51:46.980 And I'm
>
> 291 00:51:48.300 --&gt; 00:51:57.120 Sorry, I'm getting distracted to come back and be involved later as they went along, there are high school and their college career.
>
> 292 00:51:58.620 --&gt; 00:51:59.460 Next shirt, please.
>
> 293 00:52:03.870 --&gt; 00:52:13.770 Okay, this is just talks about our demographic. So earlier I talked about on male, female, so that's on here. And the other thing is I'm minority non minority, it's
>
> 294 00:52:14.910 --&gt; 00:52:21.720 Shown here are and also something we're really proud of that. We have a really diverse group of kids, we think
>
> 295 00:52:22.290 --&gt; 00:52:32.400 Having a diverse group of students gives us diversity of thought, which is a big, big tournament here in the Air Force and Emily's nodding her head at me, but
>
> 296 00:52:33.180 --&gt; 00:52:38.250 Really the diversity of thought is so important to us. So we're really looking for students from all different backgrounds.
>
> 297 00:52:38.760 --&gt; 00:52:48.540 Are all different schools and that's so important to us when we go out and look for students did to go to schools and all the areas around right pat around till around Atlanta.
>
> 298 00:52:49.140 --&gt; 00:52:56.100 So that we're getting that diversity of thought and that diversity of thought is also showing in our demographic. Next chart please.
>
> 299 00:53:00.510 --&gt; 00:53:12.180 Michael Chase: This is our pipeline and this is really just, again, I'm showing what Dan referred to as starting in kindergarten with some of those programs and
>
> 300 00:53:12.840 --&gt; 00:53:24.360 Michael Chase: Showing it kind of slim down as it get towards the end because as you if you haven't heard it before ROI return on investment is huge. So we're putting a lot of
>
> 301 00:53:24.840 --&gt; 00:53:30.600 Michael Chase: Air Force is putting a lot of money into these programs and students are loving it. So we're trying to show
>
> 302 00:53:31.440 --&gt; 00:53:35.550 Michael Chase: Those students the opportunity and give them the opportunity to come back.
>
> 303 00:53:36.150 --&gt; 00:53:44.370 Michael Chase: And work for the government if they would like i think i think that's the end of my charts, Emily. Would you be willing to talk a little bit about your
>
> 304 00:53:44.790 --&gt; 00:53:56.640 Michael Chase: Experience with legacy and your transition just mark. Yeah, anything specific you want to hit on or that you want me to. Yeah, I would like for you to talk about maybe your first couple summers and then
>
> 305 00:53:57.690 --&gt; 00:54:03.660 Michael Chase: Your college how you transition. Okay, well hopefully the birds not going to be too loud.
>
> 306 00:54:05.730 --&gt; 00:54:08.970 Many ways. I honestly first heard about
>
> 307 00:54:10.170 --&gt; 00:54:17.490 Michael Chase: So first, let me start with the school that I went to state and regional stem school and I would, frankly, call it a very interesting
>
> 308 00:54:19.290 --&gt; 00:54:25.380 It's not traditional in any sense. You have project based learning, you have required job shadowing and internships.
>
> 309 00:54:25.950 --&gt; 00:54:42.540 You. We actually have a NFL facility on the DRS campus, the AFL grill gaming research and integrated learning laboratory and I first heard about legacy through my high school counselor when looking for jobs internship opportunities.
>
> 310 00:54:46.710 --&gt; 00:54:47.580 Please pardon the word
>
> 311 00:54:50.250 --&gt; 00:54:54.510 Anyways, um, the first year that I was there, I actually
>
> 312 00:54:56.580 --&gt; 00:55:03.780 The person I was mentoring have to be a complete coincidence, because as I've mentioned, I was required to do a job shadowing and
>
> 313 00:55:04.830 --&gt; 00:55:18.300 I'd reached out to someone I knew a day for L through the science fair. And she was eventually able to get me to this person that the air for a wind tunnel complex I shot it under him for a day and
>
> 314 00:55:20.100 --&gt; 00:55:36.510 When I got got a response from Nikki, he just happened to be one of my mentors, when I was there, I actually got the allow me to work on my science fair project and that year. I ended up competing all the way up until the state level. So through school through the county
>
> 315 00:55:38.130 --&gt; 00:55:45.480 Where else through the region and through the state and God, that was great experience. Then after that.
>
> 316 00:55:46.740 --&gt; 00:55:59.490 The legacy program actually put me out at acid with mentor who they believed would work really well with me and we honestly we really do work really well together.
>
> 317 00:56:00.570 --&gt; 00:56:11.730 Michael Chase: She actually encouraged me to combine some of her interests with one of my biggest interests, which is birds, you've probably noticed me making all of these different comments about birds throughout the
>
> 318 00:56:12.420 --&gt; 00:56:18.360 Michael Chase: Throughout all of this. And that's always been something I've been interested, besides aircraft.
>
> 319 00:56:23.940 --&gt; 00:56:32.280 And I'm continuing to work on that project I've actually expanded the the network that I've dealt with it. I'm including
>
> 320 00:56:32.820 --&gt; 00:56:48.930 I'm working with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources working with the corner lab ornithology Wright Patterson Air Force bases. Natural Resources Program. I just recently got the Federal Aviation Administration and USDA office on the team as well.
>
> 321 00:56:50.100 --&gt; 00:56:58.860 When I first started, it was, it was mainly focusing on building an augmented reality program about thirds, because that's just happened to be one of her interests.
>
> 322 00:56:59.430 --&gt; 00:57:13.590 But as I've been one doing research with that. That's kind of started shifting into studying bird strikes. So, hoping that I could get funding to do research that would both benefit my project and help reduce the severity of bird strikes.
>
> 323 00:57:14.700 --&gt; 00:57:17.580 I that right now. I'm actually working on
>
> 324 00:57:18.870 --&gt; 00:57:20.580 The chicken didn't know
>
> 325 00:57:22.230 --&gt; 00:57:24.810 I kind of wish that I would like
>
> 326 00:57:30.150 --&gt; 00:57:36.030 I'm sorry, I swear he is covered. He heeds normally will normally. He is very noisy, but
>
> 327 00:57:40.710 --&gt; 00:57:46.920 Yeah. Thanks Emily Anya, would you like to talk about talk about your experience a little bit
>
> 328 00:57:48.900 --&gt; 00:57:54.120 Yeah. Um, so I am from high school. I live in Dearborn and
>
> 329 00:57:55.140 --&gt; 00:57:58.710 Michael Chase: Even though we are right next to base you would you would think that we'd have a lot of
>
> 330 00:57:59.430 --&gt; 00:58:06.180 Michael Chase: You know, like stem outreach and stuff, but we don't. So I heard about the legacy program through my high school counselor.
>
> 331 00:58:06.840 --&gt; 00:58:13.230 Michael Chase: And legacy honestly changed my life. Even though, that sounds really corny. I'm like I'm being so honest.
>
> 332 00:58:14.100 --&gt; 00:58:20.460 Michael Chase: I started legacy. When I was 16 years old. It was the first year of the legacy program. Emily was with me.
>
> 333 00:58:21.180 --&gt; 00:58:28.440 Michael Chase: There, too, so we were like the guinea pigs of the legacy program and I started working with a mentor on base and I kept that same mentor.
>
> 334 00:58:29.040 --&gt; 00:58:38.340 Michael Chase: The whole time that I was in legacy because I just love them so much. And it really got me exposed to stem electrical engineering and just how
>
> 335 00:58:39.060 --&gt; 00:58:50.910 Michael Chase: Wright Patterson air for all kind of works without legacy. I wouldn't have been able to buy my car or help my family with what we needed help with in the summers.
>
> 336 00:58:51.810 --&gt; 00:59:00.630 Michael Chase: And like Dan and Nikki was saying about it's really, it's really helping the students that don't usually get those opportunities.
>
> 337 00:59:01.380 --&gt; 00:59:10.470 Michael Chase: Like I grew up from a lower income household. So this job not only gave me experience in a field that I was interested in, but I was able to
>
> 338 00:59:11.130 --&gt; 00:59:18.180 Michael Chase: Buy my car and help out my family and I met a lot of great people through the legacy program. One of my best friends.
>
> 339 00:59:18.960 --&gt; 00:59:28.440 Michael Chase: Bree is actually someone through a legacy program. I got to speak at Star base and I've made so many great connections. My current like mentors.
>
> 340 00:59:29.160 --&gt; 00:59:34.500 Michael Chase: Like proxy supervisor right now. Dr. Amanda Bullock. I actually met through legacy as well.
>
> 341 00:59:35.040 --&gt; 00:59:43.290 Michael Chase: So it's a great program to really build your network, see what you're interested in and I'm still in contact with quite a few people that I met in the program.

> 342 00:59:43.860 --&gt; 00:59:49.650 Michael Chase: So if anybody's interested in volunteering or talking to the students that are involved. I really recommend it.
>
> 343 00:59:50.070 --&gt; 00:59:58.140 Michael Chase: I've had nothing but positive experiences with this program or any kind of outreach. I've done with them speaking to the younger students is always
>
> 344 00:59:58.500 --&gt; 01:00:06.960 Michael Chase: Amazing too because then they ask you questions and they're so curious and they want to see like what you did and maybe follow your footsteps or not.
>
> 345 01:00:07.560 --&gt; 01:00:20.280 Michael Chase: And you can just see. I really love how diverse and inclusive legacy legacy strives to be because unfortunately even working on base with my mentor was only really around
>
> 346 01:00:20.940 --&gt; 01:00:34.170 Michael Chase: Like older white men and being like a person of color and a woman that wasn't always, you know, welcoming in your workplace. So it was always nice to be go to legacy program at our lunches at our meetings and see
>
> 347 01:00:34.650 --&gt; 01:00:44.970 Michael Chase: Students of color that's not just one or two. A lot of like girls and young women in the group. And I just, I owe a lot to legacy and I would not be where I am without them.
>
> 348 01:00:48.960 --&gt; 01:00:50.700 Awesome. Thanks. And I Thanks Emily.
>
> 349 01:00:52.140 --&gt; 01:00:53.580 I'm gonna pass it back to Dan
>
> 350 01:00:57.060 --&gt; 01:01:06.030 So, so thank you. And I thank you, Emily You both are are are wonderful, wonderful people.
>
> 351 01:01:07.740 --&gt; 01:01:09.780 A couple of things you say that. Thank you.
>
> 352 01:01:11.100 --&gt; 01:01:16.140 Absolutely, absolutely. A couple of stories, real quick before I pass the baton over to Brian
>
> 353 01:01:18.720 --&gt; 01:01:25.350 Couple of things when I was doing an open house for one of the directors here at NFL
>
> 354 01:01:26.370 --&gt; 01:01:35.160 I had this girl walking through with the legacy shirt and I recognized her but I didn't know her name. It was this was in the very first year.
>
> 355 01:01:35.940 --&gt; 01:01:44.910 That legacy was going on and make we were in like the third or fourth week of the junior apprentice, and somebody asked me about legacy
>
> 356 01:01:45.660 --&gt; 01:01:57.090 And that's I was getting ready to say something and I kind of leaned over and started talking. And she said, well, wait a minute. I'll go ahead and let you do it. And I said, No, no, no, no. What, why don't you go ahead
>
> 357 01:01:58.230 --&gt; 01:02:00.240 And Anya described legacy
>
> 358 01:02:01.470 --&gt; 01:02:09.600 Perfectly. It was it was ridiculous how a student who's only had so many weeks on base.
>
> 359 01:02:10.920 --&gt; 01:02:19.710 Michael Chase: That her speaking was phenomenal her description was great and the parent that had the child. There was so excited. And so
>
> 360 01:02:20.760 --&gt; 01:02:21.270 So,
>
> 361 01:02:22.710 --&gt; 01:02:23.790 You know so pleased
>
> 362 01:02:25.110 --&gt; 01:02:40.200 With the explanation of the program that they left with a big smile. I looked over and I said, What's your name, and she said, an eye. And I'm like, I've never I to this day. I've never forgotten that. And every time I see and I just get a big smile because I know
>
> 363 01:02:41.790 --&gt; 01:02:48.150 That she's going to do great things in this world, and I hope that it will be for the Air Force or for the Department of Defense.
>
> 364 01:02:49.350 --&gt; 01:03:07.110 Emily, you know, after her first year pulled me aside in the hallway and said when she when she gets her grant or when she becomes a full time employee could she have legacy students and I kind of looked at her puzzles, like this 16 year old girls asking me if she can have students
>
> 365 01:03:09.690 --&gt; 01:03:17.160 And I absolutely and to this day still remember that. So I told both of them when they become my boss to not forget about us.
>
> 366 01:03:18.510 --&gt; 01:03:20.310 Especially when it comes to the funding parts.
>
> 367 01:03:22.020 --&gt; 01:03:29.940 But those are just two of many examples of the young people that have that are going to shape the workforce. The future workforce.
>
> 368 01:03:31.200 --&gt; 01:03:42.720 And as an I have pointed out as well. That was the volunteer circle our purpose for legacy is for the college kids to give back to the high school kids.
>
> 369 01:03:43.290 --&gt; 01:03:53.100 And give back to the craftsman. So we want to make sure there's a full circle there, so the kids can give back to the younger kids instead of looking at me.
>
> 370 01:03:53.700 --&gt; 01:04:13.530 And Nikki and my staff of all they're just the adults. Well, no, this is a 19 year old college kid that is in you know the apprentice program. Now they're getting back to the the 12 year olds. The 13 year olds. So they're seeing young faces people like them.
>
> 371 01:04:14.880 --&gt; 01:04:19.920 young folks that are in the program. And so that that's a huge piece.
>
> 372 01:04:21.270 --&gt; 01:04:21.630 And
>
> 373 01:04:23.070 --&gt; 01:04:28.530 The, the purpose of the program. A lot of people are saying, well, you know it's it's ROI. It is
>
> 374 01:04:29.040 --&gt; 01:04:40.170 But the main purpose is to IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES impact students lives and be able to give them the opportunities which this leads to the ending in game for us, at least the ones
>
> 375 01:04:40.620 --&gt; 01:04:54.990 Nikki and I and the staff are done with the legacy partner like it. Then it goes into the workforce. So during the professional development courses that we have, we have Brian Stephen, who is in the research laboratory
>
> 376 01:04:56.370 --&gt; 01:05:06.780 Michael Chase: Personnel director it. He goes, we had him come in and tell the high school kids and even the college kids. Here are some government programs student programs.
>
> 377 01:05:07.230 --&gt; 01:05:16.830 Michael Chase: And opportunities. If you want to get involved early on here is kind of the, what do you want call it the cheat code to the video game here is
>
> 378 01:05:17.430 --&gt; 01:05:25.170 Michael Chase: That the ways that you can do this and prep yourself whether you go to college. Plus Program will get college credits. When you're in high school.
>
> 379 01:05:25.800 --&gt; 01:05:29.760 Michael Chase: Here's some of the applications. Here are some of the things that you're going to need to do
>
> 380 01:05:30.450 --&gt; 01:05:38.970 Michael Chase: And to be able to accomplish in order to apply for these programs. And here's the timelines. We get calls all the time about when can I apply for smart.
>
> 381 01:05:39.330 --&gt; 01:05:49.050 Michael Chase: When can I apply for you know this, that and the other. And so Brian's our person. He's our guy. And so we invite Brian out and we connect the students with him.
>
> 382 01:05:49.500 --&gt; 01:06:03.810 Michael Chase: Scott tyrannical is another one that we connected into to be able to explain these kinds of things and be able to answer the questions and Ed's been a huge advantage on you. Kudos user, you have been a huge piece of this puzzle as well.
>
> 383 01:06:05.820 --&gt; 01:06:11.130 Between you and Brian have been phenomenal to help. So tell our students get into the pipeline so
>
> 384 01:06:12.330 --&gt; 01:06:16.830 I don't know if that Brian's online and ready to roll.
>
> 385 01:06:20.340 --&gt; 01:06:31.620 I'm alive. Finally, one, but I just want to eat. I'm not sure everything against it. But the key here is making sure students early on, have the opportunity to see
>
> 386 01:06:32.460 --&gt; 01:06:40.380 If it's government yield yield web a gas for Air Force dimmers about we provide those opportunities we give them like as Dan said she called
>
> 387 01:06:41.040 --&gt; 01:06:55.770 I even we even go as far to tell them about how to apply on USA Jobs what to do, what job announcements are really opening up since what are, what are really are not altering arguments we walk. We will even give them some insight as to
>
> 388 01:06:56.880 --&gt; 01:07:03.480 What things to do when you're applying to smart that they asked to do, we will provide insight to those students early on.
>
> 389 01:07:04.050 --&gt; 01:07:14.700 So how many stick about us students on or cold calling out the pieces doing what events that will be giving you applying to get insight early on.
>
> 390 01:07:15.270 --&gt; 01:07:36.090 Applying to a internship with us are anyone having an inside his protocol to make us to see me to set. So in doing things to eat gummy your job. So having that is what we're talking about. Do away Air Force kill our early on so you you get ingrained culture already, you understand
>
> 391 01:07:37.350 --&gt; 01:07:42.120 Coming in, what's your will be working on what opportunities are there for you and how to be successful.
>
> 392 01:07:43.680 --&gt; 01:07:48.960 Michael Chase: And like done gang. I just said is a huge advocate for us. They're making his work.
>
> 393 01:07:49.620 --&gt; 01:08:01.500 Michael Chase: He gives us time and effort as y'all can see now doing part being part of pizza and it comes in yoga energy. He comes in with the harmonica and get Botox and it comes in here and just
>
> 394 01:08:02.220 --&gt; 01:08:14.220 Michael Chase: Notice, and gives us that support. Again, we just want we just keep the movement going I'm Nikki and legacy program is great to come in and kind of put everything together.
>
> 395 01:08:14.790 --&gt; 01:08:29.250 Michael Chase: And putting those perspectives auto and guidelines and yes, it's how you are to be early on, how he isn't working, you can be professional gang a job. So we're giving them those insights early on because we want everyone to be successful.
>
> 396 01:08:31.710 --&gt; 01:08:36.390 So I'm not sure what else getting has talked about, but we are here to help you.
>
> 397 01:08:37.770 --&gt; 01:08:43.560 Thank you. Make sure you're successful reach out by day. I can't get mentioned earlier get if you want to volunteer.
>
> 398 01:08:44.070 --&gt; 01:08:51.780 Area gets close to where you're located reach out to him. He would get you in contact with that person that you can volunteer and give back.
>
> 399 01:08:52.410 --&gt; 01:09:02.460 Because it's all about giving back. You want to make sure that you leave it, you're able to advise something to someone else that you didn't have before. And that's what this is about.
>
> 400 01:09:05.670 --&gt; 01:09:05.940 Go ahead.
>
> 401 01:09:06.960 --&gt; 01:09:14.070 No, I just want to say, You're right on. And again, as we try to put this agenda together. I thought that this was a
>
> 402 01:09:15.360 --&gt; 01:09:25.740 Michael Chase: Good presentation or good briefing and by by listening to add a really chat column. A lot of folks actually are products of some of those programs they have mentioned.
>
> 403 01:09:26.430 --&gt; 01:09:34.980 Michael Chase: Which is really awesome. Hopefully they'll, they'll continue, you know, getting the word out and mentoring young folks in community.
>
> 404 01:09:36.660 --&gt; 01:09:45.330 Emily, I get to meet you, even though it's virtual but I'm so smart quickly just smart used to allow you to apply.
>
> 405 01:09:45.810 --&gt; 01:09:56.910 When you entered your senior year of high school. So in August when you began your senior year of high school, you could apply for smart, you were to get picked up. You went right into your freshman year radius smart scholar.
>
> 406 01:09:58.020 --&gt; 01:10:06.870 Well, what we figured out was that a lot of folks went in there with this great ambitions of wanting to be engineers and scientists and then realize, you know what, this is math.
>
> 407 01:10:08.010 --&gt; 01:10:12.060 Michael Chase: But now fortunately they already. The government has already paid a certain amount of dollars.
>
> 408 01:10:12.540 --&gt; 01:10:19.260 Michael Chase: To their scholarship and to their funding and all that. So now you're not the 18 year old 19 year old, you're all in the government money.
>
> 409 01:10:19.860 --&gt; 01:10:34.740 Michael Chase: So we decided to not do that. So we went a few years where you would apply as you finish what you start your freshman year of college. So if you get picked up really picking up your, your sophomore, junior and senior year in the smart scholarship
>
> 410 01:10:35.850 --&gt; 01:10:52.080 So a few folks decided to talk to us, D and our meetings and said, you know, there's some young talent out there you know Brian and Dan had talked to him about some other programs and wanted to do a test pilot program and kind of kind of see how this would work. So Emily applied.
>
> 411 01:10:53.370 --&gt; 01:11:00.600 We took a chance. Not a chance. We had the right things we're looking for the student who's already doing a lot of asset needs a lot of things in STEM.
>
> 412 01:11:01.620 --&gt; 01:11:19.320 You know, showing that this is really what I want to do. She met the board. She made a top 50% and she is the pit test pilot this year for the smart program. So again, really. Yes. So we really are, you know, just, just trying to
>
> 413 01:11:20.370 --&gt; 01:11:26.280 To create awareness and try to grow the STEM program overall and kudos to you.
>
> 414 01:11:28.110 --&gt; 01:11:44.490 For that Brian kinda, kinda fought for you on that. And we looked at all your documents and the board looked at it and we felt like we want to do a test pilot and so that's you. So anyway, but I'm honored. Thank you. Oh, you're very welcome. So once you get the burst to talk and say add
>

>
> 421 01:12:43.380 --&gt; 01:12:53.820 Yeah, I just wanted to take a moment to thank our speakers, you know, Dan and Brian and Emily and Nikki and
>
> 422 01:12:54.870 --&gt; 01:13:08.700 An eye and you know I'm volunteering has been a big part of my career and something that I've been interested in as a scientist and engineer. That's probably why I gravitated towards the society women engineers.
>
> 423 01:13:09.720 --&gt; 01:13:13.680 Because volunteering and giving back as another big part of that society, but
>
> 424 01:13:15.000 --&gt; 01:13:23.310 Michael Chase: I hope you all enjoyed, and I hope you kind of saw one another. One of the really cool benefits that some of us are able to get from a government job.
>
> 425 01:13:24.120 --&gt; 01:13:29.100 Michael Chase: And you know if this is something that you're interested in. It might be something that you're able to get really involved in
>
> 426 01:13:29.790 --&gt; 01:13:36.000 Michael Chase: And be able to make a difference. So, you know, that looks different from for everybody because everybody comes from a different
>
> 427 01:13:36.870 --&gt; 01:13:46.620 Michael Chase: Different experiences different backgrounds. But to me, I always thought it was amazing that I could do a little bit of STEM volunteering.
>
> 428 01:13:47.040 --&gt; 01:13:56.940 Michael Chase: While working for the Air Force. Once I found that out. I definitely took advantage. And when it was a good chance, um, as far as administrative remarks guys tomorrow.
>
> 429 01:13:57.570 --&gt; 01:14:09.570 Michael Chase: Good news, we're starting a little bit later. I think we're sharing at 08 30 Central Time. So that'll be good news, you look for leaders to send out the schedule a little bit later.
>
> 430 01:14:10.080 --&gt; 01:14:20.040 Michael Chase: And again, I wanted to thank our guests so much and kind of kind of glad we were able to keep it a little bit shorter for our afternoon time ed or Lita, do you have anything else.
