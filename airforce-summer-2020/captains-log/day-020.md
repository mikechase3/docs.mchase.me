# Day 020

## Mentoring

Ms. Vendrine talks a ton. She asked me if I'd stay in the Air Force, and I hinted "maybe" and said Facebook was still in the mix and she encouraged me to stay with the Air Force. Her assistant she brought on was pretty cool.

>
> 42
>
> 00:03:39.510 --&gt; 00:03:42.150
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: And sort of will be going with science and engineering.
>
> 43
>
> 00:03:43.980 --&gt; 00:03:54.000
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: So some positive impacts that have happened presents engineering field during a covenant team will be research and a lot of time to catch up on people's projects and publications
>
> 44
>
> 00:03:54.960 --&gt; 00:04:11.400
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: But some new impacts will be such as difficulties and sending class white papers via email sense such instances to be on base, which again to kind of restrict people from going on based testing which needs to provision and of course some delays as public safety.
>
> 45
>
> 00:04:12.660 --&gt; 00:04:32.460
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: Social justice. We could have come up with for future instances pandemics will be bringing more autonomy to the workplace. Have you seen those pictures for security mobility and such to further reduce visits and receive quarantine or the content, while still pointing that mission.

> Michael Chase: To know anything about civil
>
> 53
>
> 00:05:03.750 --&gt; 00:05:22.200
>
> Andrew Swisher: Alright so we got civil engineering here I'm Andrew and for the civil engineering. We got our positive or negative impacts and then our suggestions, only thing we have so far is that negative impacts is real short just because of manufacturing closures.
>
> 54
>
> 00:05:23.700 --&gt; 00:05:24.720
>
> Andrew Swisher: Okay, and more soon, though.

> 59
>
> 00:05:40.050 --&gt; 00:05:52.080
>
> Madison Gibson: dacha okay real quick. How did y'all get the the positive impact and negative impacts, like all that to, like, why not like that because I could only do
>
> 60
>
> 00:05:53.430 --&gt; 00:05:53.910

>
> 62
>
> 00:05:56.880 --&gt; 00:05:59.550
>
> Geneva Anderson: You can probably just literally copy the slide and change the title.
>
> 63
>
> 00:06:00.000 --&gt; 00:06:02.610
>
> Karlyle Munz: Just come to the next slide, and it's
>
> 64
>
> 00:06:07.260 --&gt; 00:06:12.600
>
> Michael Chase: All right, contracting is up next, what do we have to say about contracting

>
> Geneva Anderson: You're not here.
>
> 66
>
> 00:06:16.140 --&gt; 00:06:28.710
>
> Michael Chase: Not here. All right, good job, contracting. And last but not least, communication and information, perhaps the most important axon not gonna say anything. What do we have to talk back here.
>
> 67
>
> 00:06:30.450 --&gt; 00:06:33.480
>
> Kody Ellis: This is Cody and need to

> 68
>
> 00:06:36.870 --&gt; 00:06:40.080
>
> Michael Chase: That's fine. Yeah, okay, I can barely hear you.
>
> 69
>
> 00:06:42.030 --&gt; 00:06:48.630
>
> Michael Chase: But okay, so we'll work on that and make sure that everyone is audible
>
> 70
>
> 00:06:49.260 --&gt; 00:06:58.650
>
> Maddie: Hey, that's what I was gonna say is that since we're doing this on a video and you're not really gonna be able to like repeat yourself like if someone like oh I can't hear you. You know,
>
> 71
>
> 00:06:59.670 --&gt; 00:07:09.870
>
> Maddie: So make sure we're talking too low and first of all make it last longer. And I think there's a time limit. Right. So, oh, maybe not, but whatever. Make it talk slow and then
>
> 72
>
> 00:07:10.620 --&gt; 00:07:19.680
>
> Maddie: Make sure that if you're using a headset. Make sure that like you know that it works and that it's loud because, yeah, could you when you first start talking. I couldn't really hear you, it got better like through the sentence. You said
>
> 73
>
> 00:07:20.880 --&gt; 00:07:28.110
>
> Maddie: And then Michael at the beginning, you were kind of fast. So I was like, I mean, obviously I could understand you. But just like make sure that we're going slow and talking
>
> 74
>
> 00:07:28.590 --&gt; 00:07:36.540
>
> Maddie: loudly and into our mark phone so that because it's whirling and I don't want to record this 700 times because you can't hear one person very end, you know,
>
> 75
>
> 00:07:36.930 --&gt; 00:07:37.230
>
> Right.
>
> 76
>
> 00:07:38.310 --&gt; 00:07:47.100
>
> Michael Chase: Okay, what I'm going to ask you all to do is like when we asked, you know, our last day together and we record it. I'll ask you to
>
> 77
>
> 00:07:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:03.090
>
> Michael Chase: Just take your iPhone or whatever recording device you have and laid in front of you. So if the audio ever cuts out like when I go to edit the video, I'll just go. Fine. Whatever it takes we were on and replace that
>
> 78
>
> 00:08:04.590 --&gt; 00:08:05.220
>
> Michael Chase: Anyways,
>
> 79

>
> 81
>
> 00:08:10.110 --&gt; 00:08:13.530
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: I'm gonna do collect a bigger, more creative.
>
> 82
>
> 00:08:14.010 --&gt; 00:08:28.080
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: Yeah. Do I think me send me three challenges in transition to like each group would wish. I'm gonna kind of go pop up and we can I can I can know some TV shows you some this which seems a little pop up like that'd be like
>
> 83
>
> 00:08:29.490 --&gt; 00:08:29.730
>
> Michael Chase: Wait.
>
> 84
>
> 00:08:31.800 --&gt; 00:08:35.850
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: So can I can want to stand for a sense engineering that kind of pops up to transition
>
> 85
>
> 00:08:38.460 --&gt; 00:08:38.940
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: Yeah.
>
> 86
>

>
> Yeah.
>
> 87
>
> 00:08:42.990 --&gt; 00:08:45.090
>
> Karlyle Munz: Putting the person's face right next to it as well.
>
> 88
>
> 00:08:48.300 --&gt; 00:08:51.210
>
> Karlyle Munz: Where are you gonna put like the person's face the bottom of the screen is talking
>
> 89
>
> 00:08:51.900 --&gt; 00:08:53.010
>
> Michael Chase: Um, yeah, I
>
> 90
>
> 00:08:53.100 --&gt; 00:08:53.280
>
> Anthony Rodriguez - Edwards AFB: Think
>
> 91
>
> 00:08:54.150 --&gt; 00:08:58.770
>
> Michael Chase: I think that would work, it would be okay. You can't see my whole screen, can you
>
> 92
>
> 00:09:01.140 --&gt; 00:09:03.960
>
> Michael Chase: I would probably put the person who's talking in the top right.
>
> 93
>
> 00:09:05.130 --&gt; 00:09:05.490
>
> Michael Chase: Oops.
>
> 94
>
> 00:09:07.170 --&gt; 00:09:09.930
>
> Michael Chase: Somewhere where it makes sense. I haven't figured it out yet.
>
> 95
>
> 00:09:11.040 --&gt; 00:09:13.680
>
> Karlyle Munz: In between the first person in the title.
>
> 96
>
> 00:09:15.240 --&gt; 00:09:19.500
>
> Maddie: I think we should be bottom left, because there's not really ever anything down there in that corner and
>
> 97
>
> 00:09:19.830 --&gt; 00:09:27.990
>
> Maddie: Okay, like over here on the rights to page number at the top is the title. The other side is the emblem. So, bottom left, there's not really anything there, you know,
>
> 98
>
> 00:09:28.980 --&gt; 00:09:30.450
>
> Michael Chase: Okay. Yeah, that's good.
>
> 99
>
> 00:09:30.600 --&gt; 00:09:36.690
>
> Maddie: There's nothing you can cover up if you know so you can keep them the same place, the whole time. Okay, does that make sense.
>
> 100
>
> 00:09:37.380 --&gt; 00:09:39.210
>
> Michael Chase: Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.
>
> 101
>
> 00:09:39.450 --&gt; 00:09:40.740
>
> Maddie: I mean, everyone. I'm just saying.
>
> 102
>
> 00:09:41.610 --&gt; 00:09:42.600
>
> Michael Chase: No, I think that's good.
>
> 103
>
> 00:09:42.750 --&gt; 00:09:44.340
>
> Michael Chase: I'm fishing for ideas here.

> Michael Chase: Yeah.
>
> 105

>
> Michael Chase: Cool.
>

>
> 110
>
> 00:10:13.560 --&gt; 00:10:22.920
>
> Geneva Anderson: And, um, we recommend that on in the reserve training the AFC a Farsi uses makes more pandemic training.
>
> 111
>
> 00:10:23.670 --&gt; 00:10:35.100
>
> Geneva Anderson: Using the coven 19 scenarios as training plans. I'll have a better way to say that example would be on being prepared on how your district district supplies while social distancing
>
> 112
>
> 00:10:35.640 --&gt; 00:10:48.960
>
> Geneva Anderson: We recommend that a FRC and ensures that they have enough mass and other necessary PPS to allow all of their reservists who are working during the pandemic to be safe.
>
> 113
>
> 00:10:50.100 --&gt; 00:10:57.300

>
> 00:14:51.150 --&gt; 00:14:57.900

> 191
>
> 00:16:35.970 --&gt; 00:16:40.950

>
> 192
>
> 00:16:46.950 --&gt; 00:16:50.160

>
> 299
>
> 00:24:27.690 --&gt; 00:24:31.680

>
> 300
>
> 00:24:33.480 --&gt; 00:24:34.500

>
> 00:24:36.600 --&gt; 00:24:45.150
>
> Maddie: Like, I want to add more words that sentence. But I wouldn't add more words on the screen because that will be too much. So now when I'm presenting it, it's going to make me not really say everything I want to say.

> 303
>
> 00:24:45.660 --&gt; 00:24:48.480

>
> 00:24:51.660 --&gt; 00:24:55.260

> 306
>
> 00:24:56.730 --&gt; 00:25:03.750
>
> Maddie: I think that that's what they're looking for. That was one of the things last year. Is that like y'all put too much on the slides. We want to hear from you, not from, you know,
>
> 307
>
> 00:25:04.980 --&gt; 00:25:14.340
>
> Maddie: From the bullets. So, and I think it makes it it makes it more professional to just like how we're going to talk about and then actually be able to like go in depth about it.
>
> 308
>
> 00:25:16.710 --&gt; 00:25:22.440
>
> Maddie: But yeah, I think you can leave a picture and I think it's fine. Your words are small so it'd be fine and

>
> 00:25:23.550 --&gt; 00:25:25.320

>
> 311
>
> 00:25:36.090 --&gt; 00:25:37.680

> Maddie: No, yeah, I'm just preserve his training for this example. Yes, but that's example thing is good. We just put the x and then the thing
>
> 313
>
> 00:25:46.740 --&gt; 00:25:57.480
>
> Maddie: Yep. And then you can make all the words bigger once you have less words you can make them bigger sick and lead them better. That's response it perfect. So then now you'll know what you're going to say. During the fast response time
>
> 314
>
> 00:25:58.050 --&gt; 00:26:00.270

> 341
>
> 00:27:54.450 --&gt; 00:28:06.720
