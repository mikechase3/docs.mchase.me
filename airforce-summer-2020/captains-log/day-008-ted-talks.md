# Day 008: Ted Talks

## Legacy

* Friday, 12:00PM.
  * Eat lunch, turn your webcams on?

## Homework

* I took most of the day off.
* I only logged 2hrs of work so far I think, for legacy meetings at the GRILL and some PCIP program stuff. I'll make the rest up later; I know what I need to be working on.

## Ted Talk Tuesday

We have these Ted Talks every Tuesday where we watch a Ted Talk and talk about it with the group. That's what I'm currently working on right now.

### Nigerian Story-Reading

* She's black and read a British Book.
* White people talked about the weather, ate apples in those books.
* Because all of her books \(donated, not African\), she understood only British literature about white people.
* She didn't know that black people could exist in literature because she never read it before.

## NEO: New Employee Orientation

It's June 23, 2020 at 9:58 PM and I'm finally starting for the next several hours; what fun!
