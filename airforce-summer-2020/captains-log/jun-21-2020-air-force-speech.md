# Day 006: Air Force Speech

I liked this from Peter Paul and Mary given in Ontario:

> Well, hello. And now we are three and I've just one special thing to say form all of us. That our decision to sing together, at least a little bit each year, is due to a large degree, to the fact that we are received by such warmth and affection by so many people. Even those that are here for the first time. **Thank you, for being here.**

## Air Force What I Learned

Careers In The Air Force \| Informative, with a This I Believe Twist

## Introduction

### Attention Grabber

* I go to a college 20 minutes away from Wright-Patterson - and there’s a bit of a paradox.

* Except, of course, those who work at the Air Force Base.
* But, now, **I work at the Air Force**

### Topic Reveal

* Share what I’ve learned.
* Open the doors, and an avalanche falls.

### Credibility

* **1st year PCIP Student,** 
* Working at the 
  * The Gaming Research Integration for Learning Laboratory
  * Under the Air Force Research Laboratory 711th Human Performance Wing.
* Computer Science at the University of Dayton.

### Thesis & Preview

We’re going to dissect this chronologically: 1. Before I started. 2. During the Avalanche. 3. What I’m thinking now.

## Before I Started

1. I had my life **all figured out**

* Had me signing up with Recruiter Ervin Long.

  **Air Force Material Command**

* Research Laboratories
* Life cycle management
* Test center
* Sustainment center
* Nuclear weapons
* Installation/mission support
* Billions of dollars. 

  **Michael Moore**

* Sustainment center
* Needing people who know old programs like FORTRAN
* Nuclear uses 1950s assembly language and floppy disks.

  **Benefits and Paperwork**

* Seems like a good deal?
* They take care of you in retirement.

  **The GRILL**

* Amazing! I can use communications with computer science!
* Even theatre because I focused on lighting design.
* Video game fundamentals with children!

## Challenging Realizations

### You don’t take this job for the money.

* I can make  _a little more_ \(NO FACEBOOK\)
* Air Force, I’ll start at $37K plus some really nice bonuses.
* Trade off: Do I want complete financial freedom? Or a valuable long-term career?

### Loss Aversion

1. Economics and Psychology
2. You avoid monetary losses more than gains.
3. Trade-off: Financial freedom? Or rewarding career?

### Rewarding Jobs

1. It’s meaningful: not Zuckerberg/Bezos.
2. Happiness: paid leave for working out, teleworking, flexibility.
3. I value the community: mentoring, family, pride in your work.
4. Mentor to talk about dealing with change
5. Great, supportive PCIP personnel who sincerely care for us.
6. Appreciate diversity, not just race, but talent and jobs.
7. I haven’t even been on base yet. 

## Conclusion

### Summary: Before, During, and Now

* Before: so blinded. I knew nothing.
