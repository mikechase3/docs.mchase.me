### Step 4: Write bad & good ideas

* Explain why your idea is the absolute worst.
* The solution can't be 'doing nothing.'
* The solution should be **harmful and** **humiliating**, not just ineffective and not just harmful.

#### Noteworthy

* If you show up without a mask you have to wear dirty underwear.
* Hire a comedian that will mock & make fun of people in public places that aren't wearing masks.
* Mock and ridicule anyone wearing masks.
* Write I'm an idiot on people's foreheads in sharpie.
