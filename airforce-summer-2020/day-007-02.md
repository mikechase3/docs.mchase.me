## New Employee Orientation Cont.



## Force Development

> To keep pace with the changing environment and help civilians with continually developing, the Air Force has created a more deliberate and robust approach to developing the civilian workforce. This process is designed to develop and sustain a civilian workforce with diverse skills.
>
> The goal of civilian force development is to develop and sustain a civilian workforce that will:
>
> * Perform essential technical and occupational functions
> * Serve in leadership roles in multiple environments
> * Provide a competitive cadre of candidates prepared to fill key leadership

### Governing Documents

> The Air Force has several documents that codify this development approach. These three are the important pieces that help us create the framework. They outline the basic framework and define the three levels of leadership, tactical expertise, operational competence and strategic vision required to produce skilled,  knowledgeable, and competent Airmen.
>
> They include force development policy statements, directives, goals, expected outcomes of force development, and codify the use of competencies that apply to all Airmen.
>
> They further provide the instruction to develop competencies in all Airmen through education, training, and  experience opportunities, and instruct Air Force leaders on leveraging the civilian development continuum,  which we will discuss later in this course. These documents establish the overall construct and provide functional community leaders with career path templates.

### Competency Models

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will be an interesting read for later!
{% endhint %}

> Competency models are an organized collection of various competencies describing observable and measurable patterns of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics required to perform the mission successfully. Competency models provide a framework to effectively assess, maintain, and monitor the competencies required for mission success.
>
> Competency models used within the context of total force development enable the Air Force to maintain or modify its assignment, classification, learning and development, recruitment, retention, and other talent management policies, strategies, operations, tactics, procedures, and techniques to meet mission requirements.
>
> Competency models used within the context of the continuum of learning enable Airmen to identify competency gaps and determine the education, training, and experiences needed to meet mission requirements

### Functional and Occupational Competencies

> Functional/Occupational competencies are the knowledge, skills and abilities related to specific career field duties. They are focused on building depth of functional experience specific to areas of expertise that enable individuals to successfully perform their unique duties. They are continually under review by the various functional career field managers and sometimes rapidly evolving as the result of fielding a new weapon system or capability.  
>
> They take experiences and challenges to the different career fields, broadening as someone continues to serve. For example, if you are in the logistics career field, you may need to enhance your knowledge of production management, material management, or weapon systems program management.

### Development Levels

> **THIS PAGE IS JUST A PLACE HOLDER UNTIL WE RECEIVE THE UPDATED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM SLIDE/KEY.** 
>
> Here are the force development levels of Tactical Expertise, Operational Competence, and  Strategic Vision.  You need to understand these levels in order to understand the overall force development framework.               
>
> At the Tactical Expertise level, Airmen master their primary duty skills, learn to apply those skills, and gain an understanding of team leadership. At the Operational level, Airmen are able to understand the broader Air Force perspective and the integration of diverse people and their capabilities to execute operations.   At the Strategic Vision level, Airmen combine highly developed personal and people/team competencies. They develop a deep understanding of Air Force capabilities and how Airmen achieve synergistic results and desired effects with their operational capabilities. They also understand how the Air Force operates within joint, multinational, and interagency relationships. At this level, an Airman’s required competencies transition from the integration of people with missions to leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations.
>
> To help civilians understand the framework better, the Air Force created the Civilian Continuum of Learning, a roadmap for civilian leadership development. 
>
> These levels will be a continuing theme throughout this lesson.

### Leadership Development

> To help Airmen better understand the leadership development framework, the Air Force created the Civilian Development Continuum, a roadmap for civilian leadership development. 
>
> It is a guide to your professional and leadership development. When using this guide, it is important to remember the following: civilian development is a personal choice and it depends on your desire to seek development opportunities. The Air Force expects civilians to continually develop themselves throughout their careers.
>
> The continuum is read from bottom to top, and left to right. Programs are situated on the continuum based on development level expectations, and are categorized as Foundational and Targeted development. It is entirely based on your position, career group or grade, and experience. If you are a GS1 through 8 or equivalent, you would look at the tactical expertise level. If you are a GS 9 through 13 or equivalent, you would look at the operational competence level, and if you are a GS 14 and up or equivalent, you would look at the strategic vision level.
>
> The Air Force expects all civilians, no matter the development level focus, to complete foundational development. It all begins with the New Employee Orientation Course, a computer based training that provides civilians with basic Air Force knowledge to include: heritage, mission, core values, and customs and courtesies. That foundational development moves ahead using continuous self-development in the form of developed management and leadership learning programs through the Virtual Force Development Center.  
>
> The Air Force has an expectation that civilians aspiring for greater responsibility complete the appropriate non residence professional military education, such as Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and Air War College. Once again, it is a personal choice that depends on your desire to develop.

## Roles and Responsibilities

> In this final section, we will touch on some specific topics that will help make your own career development activities more successful. We will briefly explain the supervisor and employee roles as they relate to career development, as well as the role of a mentor. We will also provide some career planning steps, and finally, tools available to assist with career planning and development.

### Role of the Supervisor

> The supervisor's role is key to force development. Supervisors should: 
>
> * Help you understand the benefits of development
> * Participate in your development process
> * **Offer guidance and mentoring** to help you achieve mission goals
> * Acknowledge your achievements, strengths, and areas for improvement
> * Document short and long term goals and develop a plan based on your specific needs
> * Encourage team members to take opportunities for development

### Your \(My\) Role

> While your supervisor will play an important role, he or she does not have all the responsibility. You must also be an active participant in the career development process. The continuum serves as a guide and there are tools available to assist you, but you, and the decisions you make, will ultimately determine just how successful you are at reaching your goals.  
>
> Individual Development Plan \(**IDP**\). IDPs are designed for federal employees who want to improve performance in their current position, develop skills/abilities that could enhance their promotion potential in their career field or another career field, or prepare them for managerial/supervisory positions.
>
> An **IDP is a written plan and schedule designed to meet employee’s particular developmental goals.** They provide a systematic method of planning for training and gaining experience in order to develop specific skills and knowledge needed to meet your short and long term career goals.
>
> IDPs will be used by you and your supervisor to plan training and related developmental experiences \(details, special projects, on-the-job training \(OJT\), etc.\). They can change from year to year, and their primary purpose is to help you establish reasonable goals, assess your particular strengths, and evaluate progress relative to those goals.
>
> IDPs are not mandatory except for certain supervisory and development programs including perspective Senior Executive Service \(SES\) applicants. However, all agencies encourage employees to participate in the IDP process. It is, however, required that supervisors advise, discuss, and participate in the development of IDPs with their employees who do not specifically decline it.
>
> Again, remember the expectation is to continually develop throughout your career. Take CHARGE of your own development.
>
> * Be realistic when developing your plan
> * Develop your individual development plan \(IDP\)
> * Identify career goals, education, training and experiences that will get you there
> * Use the available career development tools
> * BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT!
> * Receive supervisor input and feedback

### Mentoring

Mentoring is a relationship between two individuals based on a mutual desire for development towards career goals and objectives. The role of a mentor is very important. Take a few minutes to read about some key factors of mentoring.

* Involves having “A trusted counselor or guide”
* Normally a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person
* AF has a mentor network where the member can share a development plan with a mentor or multiple mentors
* Mentors will have the ability to view career progress, then provide feedback and advice

### Planning Development

> Because development is on-going, it is important to have a process to plan. To do this, there are FOUR basic steps:
>
> * Identify personal capabilities and job requirements
> * Discuss the functional and **institutional competencies** with your supervisor, and if applicable, your mentor or mentors
> * Create a development plan using the Civilian Development Continuum, My VECTOR, and the Virtual Force Development Center.
> * Use My VECTOR to track progress, capture programs completed, and review personnel data. 
>
> Remember, it starts with you. We will now move on to discuss other available tools and websites to assist you in planning your future development.

### My Vector

My VECTOR is an enterprise solution that supports the Air Force's goal to provide a standardized process available to all Airmen for career development and selecting mentors. The Air Force hopes to nurture and sustain Airmen's growth throughout their entire career.

### Virtual Force Development Center

> Another valuable tool for your development is the Virtual Force Development Center. It is located on the Air Force Portal, and can be accessed by going to the Force Development Page, then simply click Virtual Force Development navigation pane. It contains a collection of educational materials to support continuous supervisory and leadership development. To meet this objective, the Virtual Force Development Center has a vast array of links to useful documents, learning programs, courses, videos, books and much more, all of them focused around the Air Force **institutional competencies**. It gives you the ability to meet your expectation for continuous development.

### Air Force e-Learning

> The largest asset linked from the virtual force Development Center is Air Force e-Learning. This is a resource containing learning programs based on the Air Force Institutional Competencies, as well as articles, books, and more. This site can also be accessed from the Air Force Portal home page by selecting the Air Force e-Learning link underneath the career and training tab. From there, simply put in a topic or subject in the search engine, and the site will display courses, simulations, exercises, and books based on the information you provided.
>
> This site can also be accessed from the Air Force Portal home page by selecting the Air Force e-Learning link underneath the Top Portal Links block. From there, simply put in a topic or subject in the search engine, and the site will display courses, simulations, exercises, and books based on the information you provided. For example, if you put Managing Change in the search engine, the site displays over two thousand nine hundred items for educational use.
>
> For questions regarding this site, see your Force Support Squadron \(FSS\) Force Development Flight or your supervisor.

### USAF Civilian Development School

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

> **Mission:** Provide Air Force civilian leadership, management, behavioral and air-power subjects through an undergraduate program and professional continuing education courses to deliberately develop AF Civilians in alignment with the law, DoD Supervisor/Manager framework, and AETC’s continuum of learning.
>
> **Vision:** The first choice for developing and executing Air Force Civilian Education and Training. 
>
> We believe Civilian Development is a deliberate process based on a career-long Continuum of Learning.  We execute the civilian development through the use of the Civilian Supervisory/Managerial and Leadership Development Continuum.  This learning continuum is designed to on-command \(required\) and on-demand \(voluntary\) development opportunities throughout the various phases of a civilian employee's career.  Courses are adaptive to the Air Force's ever changing environment and responsive to the needs of both our functional leaders and students.  We believe that civilian employees are a vital component of the Total Force and investing in the continuous development of our civilian employees is critical to achieving the Air Force mission.  The courses and programs that comprise the continuum of learning is based on an integrated concept where each course builds upon each previous course, ensuring we deliver deliberate education at the right time and place in each individual's career.
>
> **The Continuum:**            
>
> * _Provides a road map for development through voluntary leadership development opportunities and mandatory supervisory and managerial training for civilians and supervisors of civilian employees_ 
> * _Provides an Air Force-sponsored and funded Associate Degree opportunity through the annual Civilian Developmental Education \(CDE\) call to allow civilian to earn an Associate Degree with little-to-no cost_
> * _Provides self-paced as well as blended learning programs that enable continuous learning and development and support student learning outcomes established within each course_
> * _Synchronizes civilian institutional leadership development programs to better align with other learning opportunities such as PME and CDE_
> * _Clarifies what the Air Force values in leadership development for civilians_
> * _Links civilian development to our **AF institutional competencies**_
> * _Establishes requirements and expectations for civilian development._ 
>
> **How do I read/use the continuum?**
>
> Courses on the continuum are categorized as either on-command \(mandatory\) or on-demand \(voluntary\) development.  The Air Force expects all civilian employees to complete on-command development at the appropriate time based on the employee's current level of experience in the  Air Force and within their specific position, career group or grade.  On-demand development provides additional opportunities for civilians who desire additional development that may enhance their opportunity for advancement or to serve in positions of increased responsibility. 
>
> Civilian Development begins the moment an individual accepts employment with the Air Force.  This is shown on the left side of the Continuum as "**Orientation**."  The New Employee Orientation course provides new Air Force civilian employees with orientation to the Air Force organizational environment and knowledge and appreciation USAF civilian culture.  
>
> After Orientation and continuing from left to right, the Air Force provides on-demand **Leadership Development** opportunities for employees who desire to establish, improve or enhance their leadership skills and abilities.  The competencies taught in these optional courses are based on Air Force **institutional competencies** and have varying degrees of eligibility, requirements, and expectations based on the employee's current development and experience level.  The **USAF Emerging Leader** course is for employees with no leadership experience, but have a desire to establish their own individual leadership style and capabilities. The **USAF Developing Team Leader** course is for civilian employees who wish to develop their capability to lead small teams of employees that have been formed to accomplish a specific mission.  Finally, the **USAF Developing Organizational Leader** course is for more experienced employees who wish to develop the capability to lead more complex positions within an organizational setting, such as Flight Chief or Squadron Director positions at the installation/wing-level or a Branch or Division Chief at the headquarters/staff-level.
>
> The courses that comprise **Supervisory and Managerial Development** are all mandatory courses based upon the supervisory status associated with the employee's current position.  These courses are designed to provide initial and recurring supervisory and managerial training for personnel assigned to first-level, second-level and senior-level supervisory/managerial positions.  These mandatory courses ensure compliance with 5 USC Section 412 and are designed to deliver the right education at the appropriate time based on each individual supervisor's experience level.
>
> _**Below the Supervisory & Management Development and Leadership Development paths are voluntary courses and links to material you can use throughout your career:**_
>
> The first block provides information on the Civilian Associate of Applied Science Degree in AF Leadership and Management Studies. This is a new program that was offered for the first time Air Force-wide in the Civilian Development Education call that was released in March 2017.  This program is the first degree program in the Air Force designed specifically for civilian employees.  The program is open to all permanent appropriated fund employees in all grades, career series and pay systems.  New civilians aren't eligible until they pass their 2 year probationary period.  More information and eligibility requirements can be found on [the AAS website.Links to an external site.](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Eaker-Center/FSPDS/Display/Article/1088474/)
>
> The second block identifies a host of programs that enable learning for employees at any stage of their career or development.  The virtual Force Development Center \(vFDC\) is located on the Air Force Portal and is available 24/7.  Every Airmen is encouraged to visit the vFDC as it is a one-stop site that links to numerous self-development and institutional force development resources.  You can find links to all the courses identified on this continuum on the[ vFDC web site \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s0ECF2BB84DBEAE7B014DD46E712201EF).   \(Requires CAC access\)

### Force Development is Multidimensional

> * The Air Force prepares Airmen for leadership
> * Experience blended with skills, knowledge, and motivation, refines occupational skills and enduring **leadership competencies**
> * Deliberate career planning and development prepare Airmen to meet mission requirements
> * The Air Force leverages competencies

## Civilian Personnel Administration

> Welcome to the Personnel Administration module. This module describes the varying aspects and gives you a basic understanding of your benefits, such as: leave, work schedule, employee and labor management relations, and compensation areas.
>
> **Objective:** To provide basic knowledge of AF personnel policies and employee services.
>
> Topics covered in this module include:
>
> * Work schedule
> * Leave
> * Compensation
> * Benefits
> * Retirement
> * Employee and Labor Management Relations
> * Prohibitive Practices/Whistleblower 
> * Drug Demand Reduction Program
>
> This module has seven sections, and should take approximately one hour to complete.  Some installations may not allow some of the benefits mentioned \(for example, not all installations can use PT time to workout\).  Talk to your supervisor to make what has been bargained locally.
>

### Work Schedule

> **Hours of Duty**
>
> * Generally, work is scheduled on the same hours each day
> * Changes in individual workdays and shifts may be made when dictated to meet operational requirements
> * Notice must be given when employees are to be assigned to a different tour of duty or to different hours of work
> * Advance notice requirements vary from installation to installation due to union-management negotiated agreements
>
> Please consult your supervisor regarding your tour of duty.
>
> #### ![scheduling.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255787/preview)**Types of Schedules**
>
> * Full-Time - Typical 40 hours during the workweek
> * Part-Time - A schedule less than full- time, but for a specific number of hours \(usually 16-32 hours workweek\)
> * Job Sharing - When two employees voluntarily share the duties and responsibilities of a full-time position. Job sharers are part- time employees
> * Intermittent - No prearranged work schedule
> * On-Call - Works when needed less than 6 months per year
> * Seasonal - Works on an annually recurring basis for periods of less than 12 months
>
> ![alternate work schedule.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255755/preview)**Alternate Work Schedules**
>
> * Alternative Work Schedules \(AWS\) can help managers as well as the employees
> * Decision to establish an AWS program is at the discretion of the installation commander
>
> There are two categories of AWS:
>
> * Flexible Work Schedules
> * Compressed Work Schedules
>
> ![Flexible\_Work.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255800/preview)**Flexible Work Schedules**
>
> * Some employees may work a Flexible Work Schedule which consists of workdays with:
> * Core hours
> * Flexible hours
> * Core hours are the designated period of the day when all employees must be at work
> * Flexible hours are the part of the workday when employees may \(within limits\) choose their time of arrival and departure, set by their managers
>
> ![DID-YOU-SAY-A-COMPRESSED-WORK-WEEK-SCHEDULE-.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255793/preview)**Compressed Work Schedules**
>
> * Full-time employee basic work requirement is 80 hours in a biweekly pay period
> * Part-time employee requirement is less than 80 hours that may be scheduled for less than 10 workdays
>
> Two types of compressed work schedules are:
>
> * Four-day work week - A full-time employee must work 10 hours a day, 40 hours a week, and 80 hours a biweekly pay period. The agency head determines the number of hours a part-time employee must work in a 4-day workweek and the number of hours in a biweekly pay period
> * 5-4/9 Plan - A full-time employee works eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day for a total of 80 hours in a biweekly pay period. The agency head determines the number of hours a part-time employee must work in a 9-day biweekly pay period
>
> ![Telework\_Goals-mac.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255783/preview)**Telework**
>
> The Telework Enhancement Act defines telework or teleworking as a work flexibility arrangement under which an employee performs the duties and responsibilities of such employee's position, and other authorized activities, from an approved worksite other than the location from which the employee would otherwise work.  In practice, telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to perform work, during any part of regular, paid hours, at an approved alternative worksite \(e.g. home or telework center\).
>
> #### **Temporary appointments**
>
> There are many types of temporary appointments, but the two most common are term and temporary and appointments. These appointments are expected to last for a stated specified period with a not-to-exceed date.
>
> * Term appointments [\(5 CFR Subpart C - TERM 316.301 - 304\) \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2dcabde4fe239851fad276675048dd1e&mc=true&node=sp5.1.316.c&rgn=div6) : Time limited for at least one year but not to exceed four years.
> * Temporary appointment[ \(5 CFR  Subpart D - Temporary 316.401 - 403\) \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=3b56835b48a8aef42dd2a671e35e454d&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title05/5cfr316_main_02.tpl) : Time limited not to exceed one year but could be less.
>
> Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do **not** give the employee competitive/permanent status.
>
> **Distinctions between Temporary, Seasonal, and Intermittent Employees**
>
> Temporary appointments are used to fill positions when there is no permanent need for an employee's services. For example, a temporary appointment can be used to fill a position that is not expected to last more than one year, or to meet an employment need that is scheduled to be terminated within one or two years for reasons such as an agency's reorganization or abolishment, or the completion of a specific project or peak workload.
>
> Temporary employees are eligible to earn leave and are covered by Social Security and unemployment compensation, but do not receive the other benefits provided to career civil service employees. As discussed later in my testimony, temporary employees can purchase health insurance after they have completed one year of temporary service; however, the employee must pay for the full cost of the health insurance with no Government contribution. Furthermore, these employees are generally ineligible for coverage under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program \(FEGLI\) or the Federal employees' retirement systems.
>
> The terms "seasonal" and "intermittent" relate to employees' work schedules and not the appointment type used to hire them. Seasonal and intermittent employees can therefore be either permanent employees or temporary employees. Seasonal temporary employees receive the same benefits as other temporary employees. Permanent seasonal employees allow agencies to develop an experienced cadre of employees utilizing permanent appointment authorities. These seasonal employees perform their duties on a recurring basis every year. Seasonal employment is appropriate when the work is expected to last at least six months or more during a calendar year. Recurring work that lasts less than six months is best performed by temporary employees. Consistent with the career nature of their appointments, permanent seasonal employees receive the same benefits offered to the rest of the Federal civil service.
>
> Intermittent employees are best suited for work that is sporadic and unpredictable, allowing agencies to utilize them in emergencies or when a work schedule is difficult to define. Temporary intermittent employees are generally ineligible for participation in most Federal employee benefit programs. In contrast, permanent intermittent employees are eligible for participation in Federal employees' retirement systems.

### Leave

> This section covers the different types of leave available. 
>
> ![annual leave.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255769/preview)**Annual Leave**
>
> * Annual leave is an approved, paid absence from duty
> * Full-time and part-time employees earn annual leave on a biweekly basis
> * Part-time employees accrue annual leave at rates proportional to full-time employees
> * Most Federal employees may accumulate a maximum of 240 hours which can be carried over to the next leave year
> * Any unused Annual leave exceeding this limit \(”use or lose”\) will be forfeited at the end of the leave year unless a formal exception is granted.
> * Full-time employees earned annual leave hours:
>   * Category 1 \(Employees with less than 3 years of service\) - 4 hours
>   * Category 2 \(Employees with 3 but less than 15 years of service\) - 6 hours
>   * Category 3 \(Employees with 15 or more years of service\) - 8 hours
>
> ![sick.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255776/preview)**Sick Leave**
>
> * Full-time employees accrue 4 hours sick leave per pay period
> * Sick leave accrual for part-time employees is based on their work schedule
> * There are no limits on the amount of Sick leave that can be accumulated
> * Saving your sick leave is extremely beneficial in case of an extended illness
> * You can use sick leave for:
>   * personal medical needs
>   * care of a family member for medical reasons
>   * adoption or foster related purposes
>   * family care or bereavement
>
> ![fmla.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255805/preview)**Family Medical Leave**
>
> The Family Medical Leave Act \(FMLA\) covers the following:
>
> Employee’s Health
>
> * Any employee suffering from a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform their work
> * Under certain conditions, an employee may use the 12 weeks of FMLA leave intermittently
>
> Employee’s Family
>
> * Birth of a child to the employee and the subsequent care of the child
> * Employee who wants to adopt or provide foster care for a child
> * Employee who will supply care to a spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition
>
> ![lwop.jpg](https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/19597/files/6255773/preview)**Leave without Pay**
>
> * This is an approved leave status; however, no pay is received for the hours absent
> * Management has the sole discretion to approve or deny LWOP
> * It may be appropriate to request when an absence is justified and you do not have sufficient annual or sick leave to cover the absence
>
> By law, the supervisor should grant LWOP to:
>
> * Disabled veterans for medical treatment for a service-connected disability
> * Members of the Reserves or National Guard for military training duties

Contact the hiring agency for more information on the specific compensation and benefits offered.
