## Talking Paper on COV19 Challenges

By Michael Chase \| Jun 25, 2020 \| me@mchase.me

### Introduction

#### Attention Grabber

* The impact of COVID-19 has been going surprisingly well in my PCIP program.
* There are some obvious tradeoffs.
  * I get to wake up at 10AM instead of 8AM, which I enjoy
  * I can‚Äôt see the facilities in-person.
* PCIP is going swimmingly.
  * I have a job üëè
  * I have a future at the Air Forceüëè
  * But there are limitations.

#### Topic Reveal

* Discuss my specific job, through my supervisor at the GRILL.
* How my job with children has changed.
* There are new, unsolved challenges.

#### Credibility

* I work for the GRILL.
* I have weekday meetings, everyday with the students.
* I‚Äôve seen first-hand the challenges.

#### Preview of Main Points

1. Inefficient, but temporary setbacks.
2. Challenges from a student‚Äôs perspective.
3. Challenges from an instructor‚Äôs perspective. 

### Body

#### Inefficiencies

* Much time and labor costs have been used to figure out a plan to move forward.
* Troubleshooting is much faster when you can control a computer, live, in person. 
* Explaining technical terms to non-technical students without being able to show them is possible, but takes about 3x as long. 
* I use Remote Desktop software; however, some students have poor internet connections.

**Transition**

Now that we‚Äôve discussed some of the inefficiencies that Covid-19 has caused, let‚Äôs discuss the challenges that students are facing.

#### Challenges Students Are Facing

1. Students are less comfortable with each other because we cannot even see each other \(they don‚Äôt use webcams\).
2. Troubleshooting technical difficulties takes lots of time and is generally aggravating because they do not know what we are doing, when really, we are trying to figure out the problem.
3. Students do not have access to proper hardware and cannot complete the project efficiently because they do not have graphics cards. Thus, video game design is extremely slow for them.
4. Impoverished students cannot use the GRILL‚Äôs premium equipment required to make games effectively and efficiently.

**Transition**

We‚Äôve discussed some of the challenges students are facing, let‚Äôs now turn to the problems educators are facing.

#### Mentoring/Educator Challenges

1. Mentors and facilitators cannot keep students as engaged because they do not have virtual-reality equipment or other attractive means of engagement.
2. Mentors cannot quickly troubleshoot and fix problems students are having.
3. It is more challenging to lead guided tutorials and ensure students are on the same page because they are mostly working by themselves.

### Conclusion

Covid-19 is creating many challenges for engaging new STEM students at the GRILL.
